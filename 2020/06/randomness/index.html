pattern or predictability in events&rdquo;</em>. Randomness implies &ldquo;Unpredictability&rdquo;. To
practically illustrated it: if a sequence of numbers is given and you have no
way to predict what the next number in the sequence will be - then the sequence
is random. A single number cannot ever be random. 13…ok…not random. But: 1, 3,
5, 7, 9, 11, 13 …the ‘13’ doesn’t seem very random because you could have
predicted it with almost complete certainty.</p><h1 id=theoretical-approach>Theoretical Approach</h1><h2 id=central-limit-theorem>Central Limit Theorem</h2><p>Mathematically, if $X_{1}, X_{2}, \ldots, X_{n}$ is a random sample of size $n$
taken from a population with mean $\mu$ and finite variance $\sigma^{2}$ and if
$\bar{X}$ is the sample mean, the limiting form of the distribution of
$Z=\left(\frac{X-\mu}{\sigma / N / N}\right)$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$, is the
standard normal distribution. There are no constraints on the distribution of
the input signal. It can be anything, even if the distribution of the source
signal does not seem like the Gaussian Distribution, eventually, the sample
means will be converged to Gaussian Distribution.</p><h2 id=berry-essen-theorem>Berry-Essen Theorem</h2><p>In probability theory, the central limit theorem states that, under certain
circumstances, the probability distribution of the scaled mean of a random
sample converges to a normal distribution as the sample size increases to
infinity. Under stronger assumptions, the Berry–Esseen theorem, or Berry–Esseen
inequality, gives a more quantitative result, because it also specifies the rate
at which this convergence takes place by giving a bound on the maximal error of
approximation between the normal distribution and the true distribution of the
scaled sample mean.</p><p>$$\left|F_{n}(x)-\Phi(x)\right| \leq \frac{C \rho}{\sigma^{3} \sqrt{n}}$$</p><p>Where: C is a constant, Fn is the cumulative distribution function, and $\theta$
is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution.</p><h2 id=gödels-incompleteness-theorems>Gödel&rsquo;s Incompleteness Theorems</h2><p>It is not possible at all to say is a finite series of numbers is random or not.
It is a consequence of the Gödel&rsquo;s incompleteness theorems <sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup>. For
example, if there is a number generators which creates numbers from 1 to 10 and
it is creating the sequence of &ldquo;2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2&rdquo;. However it still can be the
part of a random series and you just saw a lucky (unlucky) sequence. On the
other hand &ldquo;4,9,1,5,5,7,2,1,1,9,5,6&rdquo; is not also indicates randomness. Our
source could following a certain sequence and it start to repeat after
$(n+1)^{th}$ step.</p><h1 id=practical-examples>Practical Examples</h1><h2 id=statistical-analysis>Statistical Analysis</h2><p>The histograms of the random sequence can give information about whether the
sequence is random or not. Histogram show the discrete distribution the samples.
Therefore, according to sample distribution it is possible to make predictions
about the randomness of the signal.</p><p>The second method can be the auto-correlation test. Auto-correlation is a method
to calculate the self similarity and repeated patterns of the sequence. For this
purpose, the sequence is lagged and correlation coefficient is calculated with
the lagged version of itself.</p><p><img src=acf.png alt></p><h2 id=compressibility>Compressibility</h2><p>One of the property which indicates the randomness is compressibility.
Kolmogorov randomness states that is a signal is not random it should be
compressible <sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup>. Furthermore there is a theory depends on this
fact which is &ldquo;Compressed Sensing&rdquo;. According to this theory, the natural
signals should be compressible. Therefore, for example their total variation
should be small. Using this theory, Total variation is used as constraint during
the optimization to keep the total variation of the signal smaller. Therefore
noisy signals are cleaned with this method.</p><h2 id=true-random-generators>True Random Generators</h2><p>The true random generator is investigated since it should provide a high amount
of randomness. It is a piece of hardware equipment that creates truly random
samples when it is needed. Randomness is used in lots of places in computers
such as video rendering, cryptography, and programming. Therefore, these devices
are developed to feed computer programs with random numbers. When these devices
are designed, the pseudo-randomness is generated with high entropy input sources
<sup id=fnref:3><a href=#fn:3 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>3</a></sup>. The generated sample at t, should not give any information
about the sample before the t or the sample after the t.</p><h1 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h1><p>In the end, according to the probability theory, true randomness can not be
proven. For engineering purposes, it is only defined according to requirements
and can be measured to detect non-randomness or patterns. This may bring the
question &ldquo;Is the true randomness exist?&rdquo;. Maybe one-day physics can answer that
question <em>certainly</em>. According to the latest theories, Quantum physics suggests
that truly random events occur on the basis of Heisenberg&rsquo;s Uncertainty
Principle.</p><p><img src=con.jpeg alt></p><h1 id=references>References</h1><div class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1><p>Arbib, M. A. (1987). G ̈odel’s Incompleteness Theorem, pages
