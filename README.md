### Add comment support using disqus

I use disqus service for comments. Easy way is finding a theme support disqus. You should configure you theme's _config.yml with your disqus username. To get a username, you should create a account and configure a site. It is very easy and there is a lot of tutorials.

### Deploy your content
Go your git account and create repo named as `<username>.github.io`. Go to _config.yml and arrange deploy options as
```
deploy:
  type: git

```
First generate and then deploy. It will create static pages for all your pages, categories and tags etc. Then it will push it to your github pages. You can reach your site from `username.github.io`
```
hexo generate
hexo deploy
```
