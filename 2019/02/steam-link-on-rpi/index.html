screen view of the games to devices which is on same local area network. In this
setup, there are 2 devices. First one is the device to run the Steam and the
games which act as a server. The second one is the one which runs Steam Link and
acts as a client to this server. By using this technology you can play games
directly on a device which is connected to the same router. The connection is
also 2 way. Thus, control devices such as keyboard, mouse and game controllers
can be connected directly to the client device.</p><p>On 3rd of December, Steam announced that the Steam Link can work on Raspberry Pi
now. After I saw that, I decided to give it a try. I have tried it with my
favorite game, Dota 2. Dota 2 can be played on a Raspberry Pi using Steam Link.
It basically uses your computer as a game server. Actually, the PC is run the
Dota 2 however it casts its screen view to another computer, which in this case
is a Raspberry Pi. You can install it to your Raspberry Pi with only 2 shell
commands.</p><p>In this post, installing and running the Steam Link will be discussed. Steam
Link is a software which is developed to play high processing power intensive
games on low processing power devices. Actually, you should already have enough
system requirements for the game and this computer also should be the same local
area network.</p><p><img src=steamlink1.jpg alt></p><h3 id=installation>Installation</h3><p>The following link is from Steam Community website. They announced that Steam
Link is officially available for Raspberry Pi. The installation process is quite
easy but the basic Linux shell knowledge still is a requirement.<br><a href=https://steamcommunity.com/app/353380/discussions/0/1743353164093954254/>https://steamcommunity.com/app/353380/discussions/0/1743353164093954254/</a></p><p>The first step, using curl download the required Debian installation package.</p><pre><code class=language-shell>pi@rpi-:~ $ curl -#Of http://media.steampowered.com/steamlink/rpi/steamlink_1.0.7_armhf.deb

It is installing Steam Link Package to your Raspberry Pi.</p><pre><code class=language-bash>pi@rpi-:~ $ sudo dpkg -i steamlink_1.0.7_armhf.deb

Raspberry Pi. However, these steps are quite easy to follow and no prior shell
knowledge is required. By the way, ping is around 6 ms with ethernet connection
to your router. The ping is heavily depends on your router performance and
connection quality. I could not get sufficient results with WiFi connection to
Raspberry Pi. Therefore I connect it to external router in order to keep the
connection latency as minimum as possible.</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share; fullscreen" loading=eager referrerpolicy=strict-origin-when-cross-origin src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Oouu3DmDyM4?autoplay=0&amp;controls=1&amp;end=0&amp;loop=0&amp;mute=0&amp;start=0" style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 title="YouTube video"></iframe></div></div></article></main><footer><p>&copy; 2025 M.Ozan Unal.</p></footer><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/highlight.js@11.11.0/styles/github.min.css media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/highlight.js@11.11.0/styles/github-dark.min.css media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/highlightjs/cdn-release@11.11.1/build/highlight.min.js></script><script>hljs.highlightAll()</script></body><script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-007KSW65JL"></script><script>var dnt,doNotTrack=!1;if(!1&&(dnt=navigator.doNotTrack||window.doNotTrack||navigator.msDoNotTrack,doNotTrack=dnt=="1"||dnt=="yes"),!doNotTrack){window.dataLayer=window.dataLayer||[];function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments)}gtag("js",new Date),gtag("config","G-007KSW65JL")}</script></html>
