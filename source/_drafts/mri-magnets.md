# How Powerfull MRI Magnets

Dünyanın manyetik alanı 30 - 70 uT
Buzdolabı magneti 5 mT
Hurdalık magneti 1 T
Standart MR makineleri 3T


The dimensional units for B are therefore newtons per ampere-meter, or tesla (T).  In other words, a wire carrying a current of 1 ampere perpendicular to a magnetic field of 3.0 tesla experiences a deflecting force of 3.0 newtons (N) along each meter of its length. 
Magnetism is a fundamental property of nature. Because there is no "Unified Theory of Physics", our knowledge of magnetism, like everything else, is incomplete. Angular momenta of electrons (and to a lesser extent, nuclei) impart some magnetic characteristics to all materials. Magnetism extends as a field far beyond the atomic level, however, and is intimately connected with electrical phenomena.  Any current, moving charge, or changing electrical potential also generates a magnetic field.

Superconductivity is an unusual property of certain metals, alloys, and ceramics in which electrical resistance drops to zero when the temperature is reduced below a critical value (Tc), also known as the transition temperature.  In other materials electrical resistance decreases as the temperature is lowered but does not disappear completely. But for superconductors the resistance is truly zero.


Superconducting scanners remain on at all times as long as superconducting temperatures are maintained. The main field may be ramped down for servicing in a controlled manner with minimal loss of cryogens in about 30 minutes and restored in a few hours, but this is performed only occasionally.  In the event of an emergency, all superconducting scanners have a "quench" button that releases liquid helium into the atmosphere and turns their fields off within a few seconds.
