Hey,

Today I will come up with a very minimalistic wallpaper automation tool [**WPCTL**](https://github.com/mozanunal/wpctl). I spend most of my time on the computer. There are not too many options to have fun with while working on the computer. Interesting and colorful photos are one of the favorite entertainment sources for my daily routine. Therefore, I really like auto wallpaper changer programs which surprises me with different photos. I decided to use one of these programs. However, none of them is fulfiled my requirements. I want a wallpaper changer which should be like:
- It must have **beautifull image** sources
- It should be **configured easily**
- It should be **lightweight** and has **minimal dependency**
- It should work with **multi-monitor** and different **resolution** options
In a nutshell, I decided to develop a wallpaper changer script according to my requirements.

I started with the image source for my script. There is a website called *[Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)* which is a photo sharing website. However, it has a unique feature which differ it from similar apps. It has a very nice and license free API. To keep application similar and with minimum dependency I have written it as a bash scripts. Basically, wpctl script, get image source as argument, read the monitor resolutions and contruct Unsplash url according to them. It download the images from the constructed url and set it as wallpaper using Gnome wallpaper controller. This script also can be add as crontab script. By this, your wallpaper can be changed at the frequency you want. For source there are also 4 options. Details are from readme of [Github repository](https://github.com/mozanunal/wpctl). See you!
