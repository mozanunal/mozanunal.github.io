## Projects and Achievements

- **2017 Digilent Design Contest (Cluj, Romania)**,  It is a competition about Xilinx fpga based systems. The project for this competition was the detection of sound direction using the microphone arrays. 
- **2017 NASA Space Apps Challenge (Istanbul, Turkey)**,  It is a international hackathon organized by NASA. 1st place is taken by a project to assist people about their own UV exposure using Internet of Things systems. 
- **2014 - 2016 ITUNOM Unmanned Air Vehicle Team**. It is a team about unmanned air vehicle in Istanbul Technical University. This team participated **AUVSI Student Unmanned Air Systems Competition 2015 and 2016 (Maryland,USA)**.  In 2016, ITUNOM was 13th in total and 1st between multicopter participants. My task in this project electronic team leader. I work about image processing (Opencv) , networking, flight control systems.
