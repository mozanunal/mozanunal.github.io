[{"content":"I\u0026rsquo;m thrilled to announce the v0.2.0 release of mozanunal/sllm.nvim – a thin Neovim wrapper around Simon Willison’s amazing llm CLI. This release introduces powerful new features, most notably the ability to define LLM tools on-the-fly from your code, and further refines the plugin\u0026rsquo;s core philosophy.\nThe Neovim AI plugin space is indeed bustling! A fair question for any new entry is: where does it fit? This post aims to answer that by exploring the philosophy behind sllm.nvim and detailing what\u0026rsquo;s new in v0.2.0.\nWhy sllm.nvim? The Philosophy of a Focused Co-pilot sllm.nvim isn\u0026rsquo;t designed to be a replacement for feature-rich plugins like CodeCompanion.nvim or Copilot.nvim, but a focused alternative built on a distinct philosophy. It was born from the desire to eliminate the constant context-switching to web UIs, by bringing the power of the llm CLI and its rich context management directly into the editor.\nThe philosophy is built on four key principles:\nOn-the-fly Function Tools: A Game-Changer This is perhaps the most significant differentiator. With \u0026lt;leader\u0026gt;sF, you can visually select a Python function in your buffer and register it instantly as a tool for the LLM to use in the current conversation. No pre-configuration is needed. This is incredibly powerful for interactive development:\nAd-hoc Data Processing: Have the LLM use your own function to parse a log file or reformat a data structure. Live Codebase Interaction: Let the LLM use a function from your project to query a database or check an application\u0026rsquo;s state. This dynamic, ad-hoc workflow provides a level of integration that is unique to sllm.nvim. Radical Simplicity: It\u0026rsquo;s a Wrapper, Not a Monolith sllm.nvim is a thin wrapper around the llm CLI (~500 lines of Lua). It delegates all heavy lifting (API calls, model management, conversation history, and tool integration) to Simon Willison\u0026rsquo;s robust, battle-tested, and community-maintained tool. This keeps sllm.nvim lightweight, transparent, and easy to maintain.\nInstant Access to an Entire CLI Ecosystem By building on llm, this plugin instantly inherits its vast and growing plugin ecosystem.\nWant to use OpenRouter\u0026rsquo;s 300+ models? Just run llm install llm-openrouter. Need to feed a PDF manual or a GitHub repo into context? There are llm plugins for that. This extensibility comes \u0026ldquo;for free\u0026rdquo; and is managed at the llm level, not within the Neovim plugin. Explicit Control: You Are the Co-pilot, Not the Passenger sllm.nvim believes in a co-pilot model where you are always in control. You explicitly provide context: the current file (\u0026lt;leader\u0026gt;sa), diagnostics (\u0026lt;leader\u0026gt;sd), the output of a command like git diff (\u0026lt;leader\u0026gt;sx), a URL, or a new function tool (\u0026lt;leader\u0026gt;sF). The plugin won\u0026rsquo;t guess your intentions, ensuring a predictable, reliable, and secure interaction every time.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s New in v0.2.0? This release brings a host of improvements that double down on the core philosophy of deep llm integration and user control.\nHeadlining Features Register Tools (Functions) On-The-Fly (\u0026lt;leader\u0026gt;sF) (PR #41): As detailed above, you can now visually select a Python function and make it available to the LLM as a tool for the current session. LLM Tool Context Integration (llm -T) (PR #37): You can now browse your installed llm tools (from the CLI plugin ecosystem) and add them to the context for the LLM to use, all from within Neovim. UI and UX Enhancements Configurable Window Type (PR #33): Choose between \u0026quot;vertical\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;horizontal\u0026quot;, or \u0026quot;float\u0026quot; for the LLM buffer to suit your workflow. UI Picker \u0026amp; Notifier Support (PR #35): Integrates with mini.nvim (pick/notify) and snacks.nvim (picker/notifier) for a more native and configurable UI experience. Better Window UI (PR #43): The LLM buffer now displays the model name and an indicator for running processes, providing more clarity at a glance. Visual Selection for Prompts (PR #51): You can now visually select text and use \u0026lt;leader\u0026gt;ss to send it along with your main prompt, making it easier to focus the LLM\u0026rsquo;s attention. Core Improvements llm Default Model Support (PR #34): The plugin can now use the default model configured in your llm CLI setup, simplifying configuration. vim.ui.input Wrappers (PR #36): Better support for different input handlers for a more consistent experience. Lua Docs (PR #50): Added documentation for better maintainability and to help contributors understand the codebase. More Concise Preface \u0026amp; Agent Opinions (PR #55): The project\u0026rsquo;s philosophy documentation has been updated and clarified. For a complete list of changes, check out the Full Changelog: v0.1.0 -\u0026gt; v0.2.0.\nGet a Taste Here\u0026rsquo;s a quick look at the on-the-fly function registration in action:\nTry It Out!

What if you could bring the power of Large Language Models—powered by the incredibly flexible llm CLI by Simon Willison—directly inside Neovim, with streaming replies, model/tool selection, and one-key context management?\nToday, I’m excited to announce sllm.nvim: a (roughly 500-line) Lua plugin that brings deep llm CLI integration to Neovim in an asynchronous, focused, and highly hackable way.\nWhy sllm.nvim? llm is a CLI Swiss Army knife for working with LLMs, built by Simon Willison (creator of Django, Datasette, and sqlite-utils). It supports hundreds of models (via plugins like llm-openrouter), files, tools, and arbitrary context tricks.\nBut until now, integrating llm CLI into your real coding environment required a lot of copy-paste—and breaking flow by toggling terminals, browsers, and buffers.\nI built sllm.nvim so you can:\nChat with models in a streaming popup buffer (no annoying freezes or waiting) Add files, URLs, shell output, code selections, diagnostics—and even tools!—to the LLM context… in one keystroke Switch models and tools on the fly Get token usage/cost feedback and never overrun your limits …all without leaving Neovim. No more copy-paste error traces. No more browser tab juggling. Just ask, code, and iterate, staying in the flow.\nKey Features Interactive Chat: Ask questions and see responses stream directly into a live, markdown-formatted Neovim buffer. Context Management: In one keystroke, you can add the current file, an arbitrary URL, visual selections, diagnostics, shell command outputs, or LLM tools to be considered in your next prompt. Model \u0026amp; Tool Selection: Instantly pick from any installed llm model/plugins/tools and add them to context. Async, Non-blocking: Let LLM jobs run in the background—you keep editing or exploring. Usage Feedback: Optionally show tokens/cost for every request. UI via mini.nvim: Uses proven modules from mini.nvim for notifications and pickers—smooth and minimal. Example Workflow Open a file, highlight some lines, hit \u0026lt;leader\u0026gt;sv to add that code as context. Press \u0026lt;leader\u0026gt;ss and enter your question. Try \u0026lt;leader\u0026gt;sm to switch models, e.g. between GPT-4 and local models. Add a shell command’s output to context with \u0026lt;leader\u0026gt;sx. Add info on a bug by pressing \u0026lt;leader\u0026gt;sd (diagnostics). Need a third-party API or tool integration for your prompt? \u0026lt;leader\u0026gt;se lets you add LLM tools directly. Review token/cost estimates with every response. All responses stream into a markdown buffer—ready to reference, copy, or save.\nWant to Try It?

Randomness implies \u0026ldquo;Unpredictability\u0026rdquo;. To practically illustrated it: if a sequence of numbers is given and you have no way to predict what the next number in the sequence will be - then the sequence is random. A single number cannot ever be random. 13…ok…not random. But: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13 …the ‘13’ doesn’t seem very random because you could have predicted it with almost complete certainty.\nTheoretical Approach Central Limit Theorem Mathematically, if $X_{1}, X_{2}, \\ldots, X_{n}$ is a random sample of size $n$ taken from a population with mean $\\mu$ and finite variance $\\sigma^{2}$ and if $\\bar{X}$ is the sample mean, the limiting form of the distribution of $Z=\\left(\\frac{X-\\mu}{\\sigma / N / N}\\right)$ as $n \\rightarrow \\infty$, is the standard normal distribution. There are no constraints on the distribution of the input signal. It can be anything, even if the distribution of the source signal does not seem like the Gaussian Distribution, eventually, the sample means will be converged to Gaussian Distribution.\nBerry-Essen Theorem In probability theory, the central limit theorem states that, under certain circumstances, the probability distribution of the scaled mean of a random sample converges to a normal distribution as the sample size increases to infinity. Under stronger assumptions, the Berry–Esseen theorem, or Berry–Esseen inequality, gives a more quantitative result, because it also specifies the rate at which this convergence takes place by giving a bound on the maximal error of approximation between the normal distribution and the true distribution of the scaled sample mean.\n$$\\left|F_{n}(x)-\\Phi(x)\\right| \\leq \\frac{C \\rho}{\\sigma^{3} \\sqrt{n}}$$\nWhere: C is a constant, Fn is the cumulative distribution function, and $\\theta$ is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution.\nGödel\u0026rsquo;s Incompleteness Theorems It is not possible at all to say is a finite series of numbers is random or not. It is a consequence of the Gödel\u0026rsquo;s incompleteness theorems 1. For example, if there is a number generators which creates numbers from 1 to 10 and it is creating the sequence of \u0026ldquo;2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\u0026rdquo;. However it still can be the part of a random series and you just saw a lucky (unlucky) sequence. On the other hand \u0026ldquo;4,9,1,5,5,7,2,1,1,9,5,6\u0026rdquo; is not also indicates randomness. Our source could following a certain sequence and it start to repeat after $(n+1)^{th}$ step.\nPractical Examples Statistical Analysis The histograms of the random sequence can give information about whether the sequence is random or not. Histogram show the discrete distribution the samples. Therefore, according to sample distribution it is possible to make predictions about the randomness of the signal.\nThe second method can be the auto-correlation test. Auto-correlation is a method to calculate the self similarity and repeated patterns of the sequence. For this purpose, the sequence is lagged and correlation coefficient is calculated with the lagged version of itself.\nCompressibility One of the property which indicates the randomness is compressibility. Kolmogorov randomness states that is a signal is not random it should be compressible 2. Furthermore there is a theory depends on this fact which is \u0026ldquo;Compressed Sensing\u0026rdquo;. According to this theory, the natural signals should be compressible. Therefore, for example their total variation should be small. Using this theory, Total variation is used as constraint during the optimization to keep the total variation of the signal smaller. Therefore noisy signals are cleaned with this method.\nTrue Random Generators The true random generator is investigated since it should provide a high amount of randomness. It is a piece of hardware equipment that creates truly random samples when it is needed. Randomness is used in lots of places in computers such as video rendering, cryptography, and programming. Therefore, these devices are developed to feed computer programs with random numbers. When these devices are designed, the pseudo-randomness is generated with high entropy input sources 3. The generated sample at t, should not give any information about the sample before the t or the sample after the t.\nConclusion In the end, according to the probability theory, true randomness can not be proven. For engineering purposes, it is only defined according to requirements and can be measured to detect non-randomness or patterns. This may bring the question \u0026ldquo;Is the true randomness exist?\u0026rdquo;. Maybe one-day physics can answer that question certainly. According to the latest theories, Quantum physics suggests that truly random events occur on the basis of Heisenberg\u0026rsquo;s Uncertainty Principle.\nReferences Arbib, M. A. (1987).

The vital function in our implementation is predMaxScore. We are doing calculating this with total book score / (sign day*sign day).

Total book score is simply if in that day the library is chosen, how much of the books can be scanned until the end of total days. Of course these books are selecting according to their scores and they should be not scanned before.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 # library.py import operator class Library(object): def __init__(self, idx, nBook, nSign, nScan, books): self.id = idx self.nBook = nBook self.nSign = nSign self.nScan = nScan self.books = list(reversed(sorted(books, key=operator.attrgetter(\u0026#39;score\u0026#39;)) )) self.tempBooks = self.books[:] self.registered = False self.registeredDay = None self.solBooks = [] def predMaxScore(self, nDays, readBookSet): restDays = nDays - self.nSign if restDays \u0026lt; 0: return 0, [] unReadBooks = set([book.id for book in self.tempBooks]) - readBookSet newBooks = [] for book in self.tempBooks: if book.id in unReadBooks: newBooks.append(book) self.tempBooks = newBooks sumScore = 0 bookCap = restDays*self.nScan readBooks= self.tempBooks[:bookCap] readBooksId=[book.id for book in self.tempBooks[:bookCap]] for book in readBooks: sumScore += book.score return float(sumScore)/(float(self.nSign)**2), readBooksId def __repr__(self): return \u0026#34;Lib[{}:{}:{}--{}]\u0026#34;.format(self.nBook, self.nSign, self.nScan, self.books) class Book(object): def __init__(self, id, score, scanned=False): self.id = id self.score = score def __repr__(self): return \u0026#34;Book[{}:{}]\u0026#34;.format(self.id, self.score) Results With these scores, we were 231th in the World and 7th in Turkey.\nYou can check out my posts about Hash Code 2017 and Hash Code 2018:\nhttps://mozanunal.com/2017/07/Google-Hash-Code-2017/ https://mozanunal.com/2018/04/hash-code-2018/\nHopefully, see you again.

I think the one of the thing we did well is this \u003ccode\u003e__init__\u003c/code\u003e function.\nIt create all the objects like books, libraries even if book2score dictionary.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIt also handles the solving opeartion. It iterate trough the days and get max predicted score from every library available. When the libraries calculating the max pred scores, they get the current state as input. Therefore their predictionsa are more accurate. After the library is selected the state is updated such as day, already scanned books and state of the selected library.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"highlight\"\u003e\u003cdiv

Second critical class is \u003ccode\u003eLibrary\u003c/code\u003e class. The vital function in our implementation is predMaxScore. We are doing calculating this with\n\u003ccode\u003etotal book score / (sign day*sign day)\u003c/code\u003e. Because, during our experiments, we saw that the sign days length is quite important especially for some datasets. Total book score is simply if in that day the library is chosen, how much of the books can be scanned until the end of total days. Of course these books are selecting according to their scores and they should be not scanned before.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Hash Code 2020"},{"content":"Hello Everyone,\nJust a quick post here\u0026hellip;\nToday I have seen a code snippet which makes me quite happy.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 #include \u0026lt;stdio.h\u0026gt; int main() { int x = 10; while (x --\u0026gt; 0) // x goes to 0 { printf(\u0026#34;%d \u0026#34;, x); } } The the output of this is:\n1 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 It was a little suprising for me at first sight. I thought that what the hell is --\u0026gt; operator. After then I understand that it is actually x-- and \u0026gt;. X compared with 0 (cheked if it is bigger than 0) and then it is decremented by 1. Therefore, this loop can be decoded to this:\n1 2 3 4 5 while (x \u0026gt; 0) // x goes to 0 { x = x - 1; printf(\u0026#34;%d \u0026#34;, x); } After the mistery solved, I still like this approach. I am planning to use it in my code.\nHope to see you soon, again.\n","permalink":"https://mozanunal.com/2020/03/coolest-c-trick/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eHello Everyone,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust a quick post here\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday I have seen a code snippet which makes me quite happy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"highlight\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"chroma\"\u003e\n\u003ctable class=\"lntable\"\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd class=\"lntd\"\u003e\n\u003cpre tabindex=\"0\" class=\"chroma\"\u003e\u003ccode\u003e\u003cspan class=\"lnt\"\u003e1\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"lnt\"\u003e2\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"lnt\"\u003e3\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"lnt\"\u003e4\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"lnt\"\u003e5\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"lnt\"\u003e6\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"lnt\"\u003e7\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"lnt\"\u003e8\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"lnt\"\u003e9\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003ctd class=\"lntd\"\u003e\n\u003cpre tabindex=\"0\" class=\"chroma\"\u003e\u003ccode class=\"language-cpp\" data-lang=\"cpp\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"line\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"cl\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"cp\"\u003e#include\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"cpf\"\u003e\u0026lt;stdio.h\u0026gt;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"cp\"\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"line\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"cl\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"cp\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"kt\"\u003eint\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"nf\"\u003emain\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"p\"\u003e()\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"line\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"cl\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"p\"\u003e{\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"line\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"cl\"\u003e    \u003cspan class=\"kt\"\u003eint\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"n\"\u003ex\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"o\"\u003e=\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"mi\"\u003e10\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"p\"\u003e;\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"line\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"cl\"\u003e    \u003cspan class=\"k\"\u003ewhile\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"p\"\u003e(\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"n\"\u003ex\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"o\"\u003e--\u0026gt;\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"mi\"\u003e0\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"p\"\u003e)\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"c1\"\u003e// x goes to 0\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"line\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"cl\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"c1\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e    \u003cspan class=\"p\"\u003e{\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"line\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"cl\"\u003e        \u003cspan class=\"n\"\u003eprintf\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"p\"\u003e(\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"s\"\u003e\u0026#34;%d \u0026#34;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"p\"\u003e,\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"n\"\u003ex\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"p\"\u003e);\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"line\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"cl\"\u003e    \u003cspan class=\"p\"\u003e}\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"line\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"cl\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"p\"\u003e}\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003c/table\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe the output of this is:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"highlight\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"chroma\"\u003e\n\u003ctable class=\"lntable\"\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd class=\"lntd\"\u003e\n\u003cpre tabindex=\"0\" class=\"chroma\"\u003e\u003ccode\u003e\u003cspan class=\"lnt\"\u003e1\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003ctd class=\"lntd\"\u003e\n\u003cpre tabindex=\"0\" class=\"chroma\"\u003e\u003ccode class=\"language-fallback\" data-lang=\"fallback\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"line\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"cl\"\u003e9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003c/table\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt was a little suprising for me at first sight.\nI thought that what the hell is \u003ccode\u003e--\u0026gt;\u003c/code\u003e operator.\nAfter then I understand that it is actually \u003ccode\u003ex--\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003e\u0026gt;\u003c/code\u003e.

Let\u0026rsquo;s start!\nWhat is ECG? Electrocardiography (ECG) is the measurement of the bioelectrical activity during the contraction and relaxation stages of the atria and ventricles of the heart, the stimulation of the heart and the conduction of the stimulus. ECG signal has some specific waves which correspond to particular conditions.\nPart of the ECG Signal ECG Circuit During this process, a 9V battery was used as a source to prevent leakage current through the person to whom the electrodes were connected and the sockets to which the oscilloscopes were connected were checked. Also, in case of any leakage, the person was allowed to separate his feet from the floor with the help of the plastic chair he was sitting during the experiment and not to be in physical contact with any person. The electrode attached to the right leg is connected to the low-potential end (ground) of the battery as shown in the figure above. The remaining two electrode terminals were connected to the negative and positive input terminals on pins 2 and 3 of the INA118. A quite simple circuit is created. It is shown in the next image. It basically consists of 3 components: 2 x 9V battery, instrumentation amplifier INA118 with proper connection and a gain resistor, and electrode connections. The circuit is not the main focus of this post. For further information please send me an email. In this post, I will focus on digital filters that can be used to filter out the noise from the ECG signal.\nECG Circuit Schematic Cleaning Noise Scope image of the output signal of the ECG circuit The output of the circuit sampled using a digital oscilloscope and then it is exported as CSV file. The file consists of 8000 samples for 2 seconds time window which means 4 kHz sampling frequency. The raw oscilloscope output can be examined from the next figure.\nRaw ECG Data First, the frequency domain components of the ECG data are examined. FFT transform is applied to data and its frequency components are plotted in the next figure. Since the Nyquist theorem says that maximum frequency can be measured is half of the sampling frequency, the max frequency component is 2 kHz.\n0 - 2 kHz Frequency Spectrum In the next figure, the plot is zoomed to frequency components between 0 - 200 Hz. As you can see from the plot, there is a big noise component at 50 Hz frequency because of the mains electricity. It should be filtered for a cleaner ECG signal.\n0 - 200 Hz Frequency Spectrum A digital IIR filter is designed to filter out a 50 Hz frequency component. It is a Chebyshev Type 2 filter with 16 filter coefficients. It provides -60 dB gain between 47 - 53 Hz.\n50 Hz Band Stop Filter After the filtering, the frequency domain components are examined again. The noise component at 50 Hz is removed from the signal.\nFrequency Domain Result The time-domain result of the filter can be examined in the next figure. As you can see from this figure, the time domain components of the ECG is cleaner.\nTime Domain Result The next filter is designed to remove high-frequency noise from the signal. For this purpose, a 0-200 Hz low pass filter is designed.\n0 - 200 Hz Low Pass Filter Time Domain Result Finally, A simple moving average filter is applied to the signal. The next figure is the final result of our ECG project. After the filtering operations, most of the ECG components are cleaner and now it is easier to extract ECG components from the signal.\n100 Point Simple Moving Average Filtered Signal Test it yourself Click here to download the code and the ECG signal example\n","permalink":"https://mozanunal.com/2019/11/ecg-signal/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eHello everyone,\nToday, I will show how can you filter out the noise from the raw ECG signal.

It is also my first python package which is published over PyPI. In this very post, I will try to answer questions like: How is it developed? What are the challenges? How should a package created and deployed over PyPI? Let\u0026rsquo;s continue!\nImg2sh is a tool to show images directly on the terminal. For colored images, 256 xterm color support is required. This script basically resizes the image with anti-aliasing and quantized its colors to xterm color pallette. Github repository of the project can be reached from here\nDemo Testing the package is super easy. Install using pip and run.\n1 2 pip install img2sh --user img2sh demo.jpeg Result:\nInteractive mode\n1 2 3 4 5 img2sh demo.jpeg -w 80 -i q: quit z: zoom+ x: zoom- c: reset arrow keys for navigation cmd: q For detailed usage arguments:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 $ python img2sh/cli.py --help usage: cli.py [-h] [-w WIDTH] [-i] Image Show images directly on terminal. positional arguments: Image the directory of the image which will be opened optional arguments: -h, --help show this help message and exit -w WIDTH, --width WIDTH image width on the terminal -i, --interactive open image in interactive mode Story As it can be understood from its name, img2sh is a python app to show images directly in the terminal. I think it could be helpful when connected over ssh to a server with no desktop environment. The images can be examined quickly on the terminal screen. While the tool was developed, the followings are the challenges I have encountered.\nImages In the digital world, images are made of pixels. Pixel is the smallest part of the image which can contain only one color. Color changes with the pixel intensity values. To keep it simple, I added a grayscale image to illustrate the pixel concept. It is a quite low resolution, grayscale image. Pixel values are shown in the following image. Pixel intensity values are changing with how far the pixel value close to black or white.\nColored images basically work with the same concept. The difference is colored images are usually indicated with 3 different pixel values which are red, blue and green. By this method, the proportion of these color intensity is changed to show different colors on screen.\nColors in terminal How the coloring mechanism works in the terminal should be figured out to implement this app. I understood clearly how colors are handling in an image using the following link. After that, I have found colored python module which provides support for colored terminal output from python apps. I implement the colors using this library.\nhttp://jafrog.com/2013/11/23/colors-in-terminal.html\nParsing command-line arguments How should the command line arguments be parsed? Actually it is quite easy with python. Let\u0026rsquo;s examine the next code block:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 import argparse parser = argparse.ArgumentParser( description=\u0026#39;Show images directly on terminal.\u0026#39;) parser.add_argument(\u0026#34;Image\u0026#34;, help=\u0026#34;the directory of the image which will be opened\u0026#34;) parser.add_argument( \u0026#34;-w\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;--width\u0026#34;, help=\u0026#34;image width on the terminal\u0026#34;, type=int ) parser.add_argument( \u0026#34;-i\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;--interactive\u0026#34;, default=False, action=\u0026#39;store_true\u0026#39;, help=\u0026#34;open image in interactive mode\u0026#34;, ) args = parser.parse_args() After the initialization, arguments can be used with commands like args.width. The arguments can be configured as mandatory or optional and the type of argument also be specified. This package is a pretty useful and standard package that is widely used most of the python projects.\nImage formats For further improvement in the project, it should be solved how different image formats can handle. Fortunately, Pillow package can handle various kinds of image formats such as jpeg, png, tiff. This packet can provide pixel values for different image types using the same get_pixel method interface. However, the problem is the dimension of the color values are representing. At standard jpeg a pixel value is represented with 24 bits which are 3 bytes. Each byte value represents a different color channels Red, Blue, and Green. Png differs from the alpha channel. At PNG images, colors are created with 4 bytes. Red, Blue, Green, and Alpha. Alpha is the transparency channel of the image. So the dimension of the pixel is different. But this problem is easily solved in findNearestColor function. In these functions, the dimension of the pixel is handled.\nSetup.py In this section, I will try to answer the question that how to create a setup.py file which supports also entry point and can be executed without python shell. Setup.py file is used to define the python package metadata and its installation instructions.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 from setuptools import setup, find_packages with open(\u0026#39;requirements.txt\u0026#39;) as f: requirements = f.read().splitlines() setup( name=\u0026#39;img2sh\u0026#39;, version=__import__(\u0026#39;img2sh\u0026#39;).__version__, install_requires=requirements, description=( \u0026#39;Show images directly on terminal using Xterm colors.\u0026#39; ), long_description=open(\u0026#39;README.md\u0026#39;).read(), long_description_content_type=\u0026#39;text/markdown\u0026#39;, author=\u0026#34;Mehmet Ozan Unal\u0026#34;, author_email=\u0026#39;mehmetozanunal@gmail.com\u0026#39;, maintainer=\u0026#34;Mehmet Ozan Unal\u0026#34;, maintainer_email=\u0026#39;mehmetozanunal@gmail.com\u0026#39;, license=\u0026#34;MIT\u0026#34;, packages=find_packages(), platforms=[\u0026#34;all\u0026#34;], url=\u0026#39;https://github.com/mozanunal/img2sh\u0026#39;, classifiers=[ \u0026#39;Development Status :: 4 - Beta\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Operating System :: OS Independent\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Intended Audience :: Developers\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;License :: OSI Approved :: BSD License\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Programming Language :: Python\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Programming Language :: Python :: Implementation\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Programming Language :: Python :: 2\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Programming Language :: Python :: 2.7\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Programming Language :: Python :: 3\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Programming Language :: Python :: 3.4\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Programming Language :: Python :: 3.5\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Programming Language :: Python :: 3.6\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Programming Language :: Python :: 3.7\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Topic :: Software Development :: Libraries\u0026#39; ], entry_points={ \u0026#39;console_scripts\u0026#39;: [\u0026#39;img2sh=img2sh.cli:main\u0026#39;], }, ) The entry points of the module can be specified with specifying entry_points property of the object. It is defined as console script and first, the name of the executable should be written. It should be mapped to the executable python function. In my case, it is img2sh:cli:main.\nThere are useful tricks in the code block also. For example, you do not have to write a whole long description of this file. It can be read from different files like README.md. It is the same for your requirements. It still can be read from requirements.txt but with one condition. These files should be specified in the MANIFEST.in file.\nMANIFEST.in\n1 2 3 include README.md include requirements.txt include LICENCE The following link great resource to create a setup.py file. I learned from here. You should check it out. https://python-packaging.readthedocs.io/en/latest/everything.html\nUploading python package As you may already know, python packages are usually distributed using PyPI servers. When we use the pip package manager in default, packages are downloaded from this server. In this project, I want that my package can be installed over PyPI. So I created a PyPI account and upload my package there.\nto Uploading the PyPI package actually quite simple. The following commands are required to create a package from a module and to upload it to PyPI servers.\n1 2 python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel twine upload --repository-url https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/* Optimizing performance How can be the performance of the tool optimized?

Önce veri kaynağımız olan protonların RF enerjisi ile uyarılır hale getirilmesi gerekir. Bunun için hasta çok güçlü bir manyetik alan içerisine yerleştirilir. Bu manyetik etkiyle protonlar manyetik alana uygun şekilde dizilir ve uyarılmaya hazır hale gelirler. Kesit alınacak bölgeye RF enerjisi gönderilir. Protonlar bu enerjiyi alır ve enerjinin miktarına göre konumlarından saparlar. RF enerjisi kesilir. Protonlar eski konumlarına dönerler. Bu dönüş sürecinde aldıkları enerjiyi bir sinyal şeklinde yayarlar. Bu sinyal kayıt edilerek seçilen alanın Hidrojen yoğunluğuyla alakalı bilgi edinilmiş olur.\nTarihi Manyetik Rezonans görüntüleme klasik görüntüleme yöntemleri arasında en son icat edilendir. Eş zamanlı olarak 2 fizikçi tarafından 1947 yılında keşfedilmiştir( Felix Bloch - Edward Mills Purcell). İlk resim 1973 yılında Paul Lauterbur tarafından yapılmıştır. İlk klinik görüntülemeler 1977 yılında yapılmıştır. 2010 yılı itibariyle dünyada toplam 4000 MR Tarayıcı kullanılmaktadır [1].\nŞekil 1: İlk MR makinesi prototipleri\nŞekil 2: İlk Tüm vücut MR prototibi dizaynı\n2. Atomik Partiküller ve Magnetizma Radyo Frekans:\nOsilasyon frekansı 3kHz- 300GHz olan elektromanyetik dalgalara radyo frekans adı verilir.\nManyetik Alan:\nHidrojen atomu, çekirdeğinin tek protondan ibaret olması nedeniyle güçlü manyetik alana sahiptir. İnsan vücudunda bol miktarda bulunan bu çekirdek sinyal kaynağı olarak Idealdir.\nSpin :\nAtomik ve subatomik partiküllerin açısal momentumu.\nMRG Hidrojen atomunun manyetik özelliklerini kullanarak çalışır. Hidrojen atomunda bulunan proton normal şartlarda rastgele spinde döner. Fakat yüksek manyetik alan altında bütün Hidrojen atomlarının spinleri aynı yöne getirilir.\nDevinim (Presesyon), manyetik alan altında sabit manyetik alan altında açısal momentuma sahip anatomik parçacıkların yaptığı harekete denir. Bu yapılan hareketin frekansı manyetik alana ve taneciğin gyromagnetic oranına bağlıdır.\nŞekil 3: Devinim hareketinin gösterimi\nŞekil 4: Farklı elementler için gyromagnetic oranlar\nŞekil 5: Negatif gyrometrik sabiti olan parçacıkların spin yönü ile manyetik moment yönü birbirine zıttır. [2]\nProtonların presesyonlarının frekansı, manyetik alanın gücü ile doğru orantılıdır. Presesyon, manyetik rezonans olayının temelidir. Protonları etkileyebilmek için önce onları manyetik alan içerisine koyarak presesyon yaptırmak gerekir. Ancak bu durumdaki protonlar dışarıdan gönderilecek presesyon frekansındaki bir radyo dalgasıyla (RF) rezonansa girebilirler [3]. Bu rezonans frekansına Larmor frekansı denir ve gyrometric oran ile manyatik alanın çarpımıyla hesaplanır.\nŞekil 6: Farklı elemenletlerin MR görüntülemede oluşturdukları duyarlılık oranları [4]\nŞekil 7: Larmor frekenası formulü\nRezonans durumdaki Hidrojenler uyarıldıktan sonra geri eski durumlarına dönerlerken bir manyetik alanlarındaki değişimden dolayı bir sinyal yayarlar. Bu duruma relaksasyon denir. Bu uyarılma ve devamındaki zayıflarma esnasında sırasıyla aşağıdaki olaylar olur [2].\nDevinim durumundaki hidrojen atomları toplam manyeyik alan B0 manyetik alanı yönünde olacak şekilde hizalanmışlardır. Toplam net manyetik alan longitutunal (Z) düzlemde yukarı doğrudur. Transverse (X-Y) düzlemde ise toplam net manyetik alan sıfırdır. Sistem B0 manyetik alanın dik olacak bir B1 manyetik alanına sahip olan RF palslar ile uyarılır. Uyarılan sistemde net manyetik alan longitutunal düzlem sıfır olmuştur. Bu arada hidrojen atomları infaz durumuna geçer ve Z ekseni etrafında aynı fazda dönmeye başlarlar. Bu da transverse ekseninde sürekli dönen bir net manyetizasyon oluşturur. Uyarmayı yapan B1 manyetik alanı kaldırılır. Sistem eski haline dönmeye başlar. Bu olaya Free Induction Decay adı verilir. Sistemin relaksasyonu sırasında longitutional manyetik alanın eski halin gönmesine T1 relaksasyonu, transverse düzlemdeki dönmekte olan net manyetizasyonun tekrar sıfır olmasına ise T2 relaksasyonu denir. MR görüntüleme de bu iki relaksasyonun süreleri arasında yorumlar yaparak dokular hakkında bilgi edinilmeye çalışılır.\nŞekil 8: Relaksasyon sırasında toplam manyatik alanın zamana göre değişimi, Free Inductıon Decay\n3. Faraday Indüksiyon Akımı Sinyal Kaydı Faraday kanununa göre bir devrede indüklenen emk, devreden geçen manyetik akının zamana göre türevi ile doğru orantılıdır. Bu ifade şöyle yazılabilir [5]: ε: İndüklenen emk (Volt) Φ: Manyetik akı (Weber) t: Zaman (saniye) N sarımlı bir bobinde oluşan emk\nTelin Doğrusal Hareketi B manyetik alanına dik yönde v hızıyla hareket eden, l uzunluğundaki telin uçları arasında indüklenen emk Telin Dairesel Hareketi B manyetik alanına dik yönde w açısal hızıyla hareket eden, l uzunluğundaki telin uçları arasında indüklenen emk Manyetik rezonans görüntülemede faraday yasasından yola çıkararak çeşitli dizaynlar yapılmaktadır. Gradyan magnetlerden manyetik alan elektrik ile değişken olarak indüklenmesi ve vücuttan yapılan radyo dalgaları ışımalarınının rf sargılar ile alınması da bu prensibe dayanarak tasarlanır.\n4. MRG Enstrümanyasyon Şekil 9:MR Enstrümantasyonu genel bakış [6]\nSistem temel olarak aşağıdaki kompenentlerden oluşur.\nBirincil Magnetler: Birincil magnetler güçlü manyetik alanı üretmekten sorumludur. Statik güçte bir manyetik alan üretirler. Seviyeleri 1 Tesladan 3 Teslaya kadar değişebilmektedir. Bu kadar güçlü manyetik alana ulaşabilmek için genelde süper iletken kullanılır. Sürekli açık durumda bırakılırlar sadece bakım olacağı zaman bu magnetler manyetik alan üretmeyi bıraktırılır. 2000lerin başından bu yana 1.5 Teslalık magnetlerin yerini 3 Teslalık magnetler aldı [6].\nŞekil 10: Birincil magnetin oluşturduğu manyetik alanın formulü\nYukarıdaki eşitlikte görüldüğü gibi elde edilen magnetik güç akımın karesi ve direncin çarpımı ile orantılıdır. Isı kaybını önlemek için tellerin dirençleri mümkün olduğunca düşük tutulur. Bu süperiletken kullanmayı zorunlu hale getiren etkendir. Bilinen bazı materyaller çok düşük sıcaklıklarda neredeyse 0 dirence kadar düşerler. MRG\u0026rsquo;de bu teller bir kaç yüz amperi taşıyabilir durumda olmalıdırlar. Niobium ve aluminyom alaşımı bir madde ile bu sağlanabilir. Manyetik alanın homojenliği bu magnet için çok önemlidir. MR makinlerine yıllık yapılan bakımda süperiletkenliği sağlamak için kullanılan soğuk gaz yıllık olarak yenilenir. Magnetlerin dışına yerleştirilen magnetik alan önleyiciler ile bu manyetik alanın dışarıya etkisi sıfırlanmaya çalışılır. Bu kalkan olarak çelik karbon tabanlı pasif zayıflatıcılar ya da tes yönde manyetik alan üreten aktif zayıflatıcılar kullanılır.\nŞekil 11: MR makinesinin 2D kesitinde birincil magnetlerin yeri [1]\nGradyan Magnetler:\nÜç düzlemde yerleştirilmiş bu bobinler sayesinde hastanın pozisyonu değiştirilmeden her üç düzlemde de kesit alınabilir. MR sırasında çıkan yüksek sesten bu bobinler sorumludur. Z ekseninde kullanılan sarglarda 2 ayrı sargı manyetik alanı z eksenin lineer olarak değiştirilebilecek şekilde yerleştirilmiştir. X ve Y ekseninde ise (saddle coin) belirtilen eksenlere dik yönde sarım yapılacak şekide sarımlar sisteme eklenmiştir.\nŞekil 12: X,Y ve Z ekseninde gradyan magnetler\nManyetik alan gradienti manyetik alan değişiminin uzaklık değişimine oranı olarak tanımlanır.\nŞekil 13: Gradyanın Formulü [7]\nGradyan Sargılar güçlü PWM kuvvetlendiriciler ile sürülürler. Anlık olarak 2500 V ve 1000 A gibi değeler görebilirler. Böyle durumlarda iç sıcaklıkları 55 - 60 dereceye kadar ulaşabilir. Bu nedenle gradyan sargıları soğutabilmek için MR cihazlarında gerekli üniteler bulunur.\nŞekil 14: Gradyan sargılar soğutma sistemleri [7]\nRadyo Frekans Bobinleri:\nİki temel görevi vardır. Birincisi manyetik alan altındaki Hidrojen atomlarını uyararak spinlerini değiştirmlerini sağlamak ikinci olarak RF salınımı yaptığında salınan RF enerjisini toplamak için anten görevi görerek görüntünün oluşturulmasını sağlamak. Pulse sekansı oluşturarak belli bir bölgenin aktifleştirilip ölçülmesini sağlar. Genelde bir dizi radya frekans bobinleri bir arada kullanılır. Bu sayede pozisyonun alıcıya etkisindeki farklılıklar kompanze edilmeye çalışılır.\nŞekil 15: RF sargı giriş devresi örneği\nÇevre gürültülerden etkilenmemesi için ve o frekans kanalına kilitlemek için rf sargısının çıkışında aynı frekansta referans clock üretilmelidir. Bunu yapabilmek için kapasitans ve endüktans tabanlı devreler kullanılabilir. Fres frekansında sinyal üretmek için gerekli kapasite ve endüktans değeleri aşağıdaki formüle göre hesaplanabilir.\nAşağıda ise örnek bir devre şeması eklenmiştir. Verimli bir RF sargı devresi için bahsedilen frekanstaki hassasiyet yüksek ve devrenen giriş çıkış verimleri yüksek olmalıdır. Bunu sağlamak için empadans uydurma devreleri gereklidir. Bu devreler sayesinde alınan ya da yollanan sinyal koaksiyel kablonun girişinde 50 Ohm direncine getirilmelidir. Devredeki sanal komponentlerin birbirini yok etmesi de sağlanarak bu aşamada yaşanan hassasiyet kaybı en aza indirilir.\nŞekil 16: RF sargıların elektromanteik koruyucularla kaplanması(shielding)\nRF sargılara gürültü oluşturabilecek bir diğer etken de sistem içerisindeki komponentlerdir. MRG makineleri içerisinde yüksek akımların geçtiği bir çok komponent içerir bu manyetik alan ve rf tarafında kirliğe sebep olur bu gürültülerin azaltıması için sistemdeki farklı komponentler sistemden elektriksel olarak yalıtılmış durumdadır. Simetrik bir dizayn izlenerek bu gürültülerin mümkün olduğunca birbirini yok etkesi de yardımcı olabiliecek yöntemlerdendir [1].\nRf sargıların hem alıcı hem verici olarak kullanılabilmesi için aşağıdaki gibi bir devreye dönüştürümelidir. DC sinya uygulanarak diyotlar aracılığıyla sargıların çalışma yönü seçilir. Diyot olarak genelde PIN diyotlar kullanılır [7].\nŞekil 17: Örnek pals sekansı. Bilgisayar sistemi hepsini senkron olarak çalışmasından sorumludur. [8]\nBilgisayar Sistemi:\nAlınan sinyal yukarıdaki gibi demodule edllir. Demodolasyon sırasında alınan sinyal 90 derece fazı kaydırılmış hali ile çarpılır çıkan sinyalde iki tane belirgin komponent olacaktır. Birincisi sinyalin base banda indilimiş hali ikinci olarak da f0 sinyalinin tam iki katındaki komponent. Sadece basebandaki sinyal istendiği için diğer sinyal alçak geçiren filtre ile gücü azaltılır. Devrenin devamında analog dijital çeviricilerle ile sinyal dijital ortama aktarılır. Genelde örnekleme frekansı 80 MHz örnekleme çözünürlüğü ise 14 bittir [8].\nAlınan sinyallerin toplanıp çeşitli veri işleme ve 3 boyutlu tahmin yöntemleriyle insanın anlayabileceği görüntüler haline çevirildiği yerdir.\nKaynakça [1] N. \u0026amp; W.

By using this technology you can play games directly on a device which is connected to the same router. The connection is also 2 way. Thus, control devices such as keyboard, mouse and game controllers can be connected directly to the client device.\nOn 3rd of December, Steam announced that the Steam Link can work on Raspberry Pi now. After I saw that, I decided to give it a try. I have tried it with my favorite game, Dota 2. Dota 2 can be played on a Raspberry Pi using Steam Link. It basically uses your computer as a game server. Actually, the PC is run the Dota 2 however it casts its screen view to another computer, which in this case is a Raspberry Pi. You can install it to your Raspberry Pi with only 2 shell commands.\nIn this post, installing and running the Steam Link will be discussed. Steam Link is a software which is developed to play high processing power intensive games on low processing power devices. Actually, you should already have enough system requirements for the game and this computer also should be the same local area network.\nInstallation The following link is from Steam Community website. They announced that Steam Link is officially available for Raspberry Pi. The installation process is quite easy but the basic Linux shell knowledge still is a requirement.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/app/353380/discussions/0/1743353164093954254/\nThe first step, using curl download the required Debian installation package.\n1 2 pi@rpi-:~ $ curl -#Of http://media.steampowered.com/steamlink/rpi/steamlink_1.0.7_armhf.deb ######################################################################## 100.0% After downloading the package, process continues with following one line script.

Fpga programlarken öğrendiğim şeyleri farklı yazılarda paylaşmıştım. Bu yazı da o yazılardan biri diyebiliriz. Verilog ile alakalı daha ileri düzey şeylerden bahsedeceğim yazılar da gelecektir diye düşünüyorum.\nTemel Kullanımlar İlk olarak basit mantık fonksiyonlarının verilog modüllerinin oluşturulmasıyla başlamak istiyorum. Bu fonksiyonları oluşturmak için bir kaç farklı seçeneğimiz var. Ben kısaca hepsinin üzerinden geçmek istiyorum. Bu yöntemlerin hepsine aşina olmak şu açıdan önemlidir: Her projede farklı zorluklar karşımıza çıkabilir. Bu zorluklardan en çok ortaya çıkanlardan biri kaynak yetersizliğidir. Kaynak yetersizliği farklı açılardan ortaya çıkabilir.\nZamanlamanın yetersiz olması Fpgadeki mantık kapılarının yeterli olmaması Performansın yeterli olmaması Bu 3 farklı dar boğaza göre farklı imlemantasyon yöntemini tercih etmeniz gerekebilir. Aritmetik Operatör Kullanarak Aşağıdaki modül OR alan bir modül olarak tasarlanmıştır. Direk OR aritmetik oparatörü kullanarak aşağıdaki gibi oluşturulabilir. Burda dikkat çekmek istediğim ikinci şey bir modülün nasıl tanımlandığıdır. İlk olarak giriş ve çıkışlar tanımlanır. Bu modülde hepsi 1 bit olmak üzere 2 giriş 1 çıkış gereklidir. \u0026ldquo;assign\u0026rdquo; ile gerekli bağlantı yapılır. Hiç \u0026ldquo;clock\u0026rdquo; kullanılmadığı için kombinasyonel (combinational) bir modüldür.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 module OR( input I1, input I2, output O ); assign O = I1 | I2; endmodule LUT Kullanarak LUT, \u0026ldquo;look up table\u0026rdquo; teriminin kısaltmasıdır. FPGA bildiğiniz gibi verilog diliyle tasarladığımız ve zaman-kaynak sınırlamalarını aşmayan her türlü devrenin gerçeklenebildiği çip türüdür. Bu esnekliği uygulanabilir kılan FPGA yapısının en küçük birimlerindeki LUT\u0026rsquo;lardır. Yani nasıl yazarsak yazalım kodu en son LUT dönüştürülüp devre üzerine öyle aktarılır. Verilog diliyle direk olarak LUT tanımlayarak da istediğimiz mantık fonksiyonunu gerçekleyebiliriz. Aşağıda EXNOR fonksiyonu LUT kullanılarak gerçeklenmiştir.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 module EXNOR( input I1, input I2, output O ); LUT2 #(.INIT(4\u0026#39;b1001) ) LUT2_inst( .O(O), .I0(I1), .I1(I2) ); endmodule Always Kullanarak Always yapısı sadece belli durumlarda çalışan mantık devreleri yazmak için kullanıyoruz. Örneğin \u0026ldquo;if\u0026rdquo; için burada bir \u0026ldquo;always\u0026rdquo; yapısına ihtiyacımız oluyor.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 module NAND( input I1, input I2, output reg O ); always @( I1 or I2 ) begin if( I1==1 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; I2==1) begin O \u0026lt;= 1\u0026#39;b0; end else begin O \u0026lt;= 1\u0026#39;b1; end end endmodule module NOR( input I1, input I2, output reg O ); always @( I1 or I2 ) begin if( I1==0 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; I2==0) begin O \u0026lt;= 1\u0026#39;b1; end else begin O \u0026lt;= 1\u0026#39;b0; end end endmodule Case Kullanarak Case yapısı kullanarak aşağıdaki decoder kolayca gerçeklenebilir. Case kullanımı için de always yapısı gereklidir.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 module DECODER( input[3:0] IN, output reg [15:0] OUT ); always @(*) begin\tcase(IN) 4\u0026#39;b0000: OUT\u0026lt;=16\u0026#39;b0000000000000000; 4\u0026#39;b0001: OUT\u0026lt;=16\u0026#39;b0000000000000010; 4\u0026#39;b0010: OUT\u0026lt;=16\u0026#39;b0000000000000100; 4\u0026#39;b0011: OUT\u0026lt;=16\u0026#39;b0000000000001000; 4\u0026#39;b0100: OUT\u0026lt;=16\u0026#39;b0000000000010000; 4\u0026#39;b0101: OUT\u0026lt;=16\u0026#39;b0000000000100000; 4\u0026#39;b0110: OUT\u0026lt;=16\u0026#39;b0000000001000000; 4\u0026#39;b0111: OUT\u0026lt;=16\u0026#39;b0000000010000000; 4\u0026#39;b1000: OUT\u0026lt;=16\u0026#39;b0000000100000000; 4\u0026#39;b1001: OUT\u0026lt;=16\u0026#39;b0000001000000000; 4\u0026#39;b1010: OUT\u0026lt;=16\u0026#39;b0000010000000000; 4\u0026#39;b1011: OUT\u0026lt;=16\u0026#39;b0000100000000000; 4\u0026#39;b1100: OUT\u0026lt;=16\u0026#39;b0001000000000000; 4\u0026#39;b1101: OUT\u0026lt;=16\u0026#39;b0010000000000000; 4\u0026#39;b1110: OUT\u0026lt;=16\u0026#39;b0100000000000000; 4\u0026#39;b1111: OUT\u0026lt;=16\u0026#39;b1000000000000000; endcase end endmodule Modul Hiyerarşisi Önemli kullanımlardan biri de hiyerarşik modul yapısıdır. Modüller diğer modelleri alt modül olarak çağırabilir bu sayede işlevler birbirinden ayrıştırılır. Örneğin decoder oluşturulduğunda projenin kalanından ayrı olarak test edilir. Çalıştığından emin olunan bir alt parça sağlanmış olur. Diger modulleri aşadaki gibi bir yazım kurallarıyla alt modul olarak çağırabilirsiniz. Modülün giriş ve çıkışlarını üst modüldeki kablolara bağlanmanız gerekir.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 module topmodule( input [7:0]sw, input [3:0]btn, output [7:0]led, output [6:0]seg, output dp, output [3:0]an ); DEMUX demux1 ( .D(sw[0]), .S(btn[1:0]), .O(led[3:0]) ); assign an = 4\u0026#39;b1110; endmodule Aynı alt modülden farklı isimler vererek birden fazla oluşturabilirsiniz. Bu örnekte demux bir veya daha fazla kez oluşturulmuş başka alt modüller kullnarak yapılmıştır. Sonrasında da bu modül başka bir üst modülün parçası olabilir. Bu şekilde hiyerarşik bir yapı vardır.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 `timescale 1ns / 1ps module DEMUX( input D, input [1:0] S, output [3:0] O ); wire W[5:0]; NOT not1(.O(W[0]),.I(S[0])); NOT not2(.O(W[1]),.I(S[1])); AND and1(.O(W[2]),.I1(W[0]),.I2(W[1])); AND and2(.O(W[3]),.I1(S[0]),.I2(W[1])); AND and3(.O(W[4]),.I1(W[0]),.I2(S[1])); AND and4(.O(W[5]),.I1(S[0]),.I2(S[1])); TRI tri00(.O(O[0]),.I(W[2]),.E(D)); TRI tri01(.O(O[1]),.I(W[3]),.E(D)); TRI tri10(.O(O[2]),.I(W[4]),.E(D)); TRI tri11(.O(O[3]),.I(W[5]),.E(D)); endmodule Sıralı (Sequential) Mantık Devreleri Sayısal devrelerin olmazsa olmazlarından biri \u0026ldquo;clock\u0026rdquo; sinyalidir. Peki neden böyle bir şeye ihtiyaç duyulur ? Devrelerde gerçeklenmek istenen işlevler genellikle belli durumların olduğu ve zamana bağlı olarak ard arda belli durumların birbini takip etmesiyle çalışan sistemlerdir. Çoğu durum tek bir kombinasyonel devre olarak gerçeklenemez. Bir çok gerçeklenebilecek durumda da yine de sıralı devreler tercih edilir. Çünkü çok daha az kaynak kullanarak daha stabil şekilde gerçeklemeye uygun devreler bu yöntem ile elde edilebilir.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 module register( input [7:0] SW, input BTN, input CLEAR, output reg [7:0] LED ); always @(posedge BTN , posedge CLEAR) begin case (CLEAR) 1\u0026#39;b1: LED \u0026lt;= 8\u0026#39;b00000000; default: LED \u0026lt;=SW; endcase end endmodule Art-arda 4 tane 1 veya 4 tane 0 gelmesi durumunu tespit eden devrenin verilog kodu aşağıdaki gibidir. Bu devre tipi sıralı mantık devrelerine giriş niteliğinde bir örnektir. Bu devrenin kodu yazılırken ilkönce kağıt üzerinde yapılması gereken işlemler vardır. İlk olarak devrenin durumları çıkarılır. Mealy-Moore diagramı çizilerek durumlar arasındaki geçişler belirlenir ve eğer yapılabiliyorsa gerekli indirgemeler yapılır. Bu işlemlerin sonucuna göre aşağıdaki kod yazılabilir. always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) bu satır sayesinde her \u0026ldquo;clock\u0026rdquo; yükselen kenarında girişlerin değerlerine göre sistem sonraki duruma geçirilir.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 `timescale 1ns / 1ps module FSM1( input x, input reset, input clk, output reg z ); reg q0,q1,q2; wire Q0,Q1,Q2,z_new; assign Q2 = x \u0026amp; q2 | x \u0026amp; q1 \u0026amp; q0; assign Q1 = (q1 \u0026amp; (~q0)) | ((~q2) \u0026amp; (~q1) \u0026amp; q0) | (x \u0026amp; (~q2) \u0026amp; (~q1)); assign Q0 = (x \u0026amp; (~q1)) | (x \u0026amp; (~q0) | (~q2)) \u0026amp; ((~q1) \u0026amp; (~q0)); assign z_new = ((~x) \u0026amp; q1 \u0026amp; (~q0)) | (x \u0026amp; q2 \u0026amp; q0); always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin if (reset) begin q0 \u0026lt;= 0; q1 \u0026lt;= 0; q2 \u0026lt;= 0; end else begin q0 \u0026lt;= Q0; q1 \u0026lt;= Q1; q2 \u0026lt;= Q2; z= z_new; end end endmodule ","permalink":"https://mozanunal.com/2018/06/veriloga-giris/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHerkes Merhabalar,\u003c/strong\u003e\nBugün bir \u0026ldquo;hardware  description language\u0026rdquo; olan verilog diline giriş yapmak istiyorum.

Bulut tabanlı programlar oldukça populer oldu son zamanlarda. Ben bütün ofis programı ihtiyaçlarımı google\u0026rsquo;in çevrimiçi programlarıyla karşılıyorum. Google form da anket yapmanızı sağlayan bu araçlardan biri. Bu aracın olağan kullanımı anket yapmaktır. Bu projede bambaşka bir şey için kullanacağız: IOT sistemler için basit bulut sistemi.\nŞöyle ki normalde anket için yapılmış bu form sistemini IOT cihazımızdan buluta veri göndermek için kullanacağız. Bu sistem sayesinde çok fazla uğraş vermeden cihazımızı uzaktan takip edebiliyor ve verilerini izleyebiliyor olacağız. Hatta direk olarak excel sistemine aktarılacağı için direk oradan analiz bile edebiliriz. Birden fazla cihazlı sistemler bile kurmak mümkün görünüyor. Online olarak takip etmek istediğimiz şeyler olduğunda kullanılabilir gibi gözüküyor.\nBunu yapmamız için biraz olağan dışı işler yapmamız gerekli birazcık. Yapacağımız şeyi özetlemek istersem: Forma tarayıcı üzerinden yaptığımız işlemi IOT bir cihazdan ve \u0026ldquo;curl\u0026rdquo; kullanarak yapacağız.\nİlkönce yeni bir form oluşturuyoruz. Burada cihazımızdan kaç parametre alacaksak onları giriyoruz formun içine.\nBen burada cihazın idsi ve wifi rssi verisini göremek istiyorum onları giriyorum sadece.\nAşağıdaki gibi form linki alıp linke gidiyoruz.\nChrome dev console açıp id ve rssi kutucuklarına rastgele şeyler girip kaydede basıyoruz. Bildiğiniz gibi bizim kaydede basmamız aslında bir \u0026ldquo;web request\u0026rdquo; o google serverına gidip yanıt olarak veri tabanlarına kaydediliyor.\nChrome dev console üzerinden yaptığımız \u0026ldquo;web requesti\u0026rdquo; bulup curl olarak kopyalıyoruz. Bununla tüm gerekli header parametreleriyle forma girdi yapabileceğimiz bir curl komutu oluşturmuş oluyoruz.\nMesela sürekli bulut sistemine göndermek istediğimiz bir veri var. Onu bu şekilde bulut sistemine yollayabiliriz artık. Tek yapmamız gereken basit bir \u0026ldquo;sprintf\u0026rdquo; yapmak. Aldığımız değerleri bu karışık \u0026ldquo;curl request \u0026quot; içinde buluyoruz ve yerine uygun string format aracını koyuyoruz(\u0026quot;%d\u0026rdquo;,\u0026quot;%s\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;%f\u0026quot;).\nGördüğünüz gibi curl komutu oldukça karmaşık. Kodun karıştırmaması için ben bir kısmını sildim yerine 3 nokta koydum. Aşağıdaki gibi formatlayarak o stringi bulut sistemine aktaracak fonksiyonu oluşturabiliriz. Bu fonksiyonu bir döngünün içine alarak 2 dakikada bir CPU sıcaklığını bulut sistemimize aktaran bir kod yazabiliriz.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 import os, time def sendData(): val = os.popen(\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34;cat /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone*/temp\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34;).read() cmd= \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; curl \u0026#39;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIp... \u0026#39; -H \u0026#39;u729917={}\u0026amp;entry.676449722={}\u0026amp;fvv=\u0026#39; --compressed \u0026gt; /dev/null \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34;.format(\u0026#34;moz-rpi\u0026#34;,val) os.system(cmd) while True: try: sendData() time.sleep(120) except: time.sleep(120) Yukarıdaki kodun çıktısı da aşağıdaki ekran alıntısındaki gibi olacaktır.

Hatta tahminler bile oluşturabiliriz. Excel oldukça zengin seçenekler sunuyor. Bu yazımım da sonuna geldik.

Its allows users to add new packs to environment.\nBackend Data structure and Crud Outputs Sample JSON files, it can be enchance according to packet number and courier number\n/api/courier\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 [ { \u0026#34;_id\u0026#34;: 0, \u0026#34;initLocation\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;lat\u0026#34;: 40.73726833204571, \u0026#34;long\u0026#34;: -111.86816435821093 }, \u0026#34;curLocation\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;lat\u0026#34;: 40.73726833204571, \u0026#34;long\u0026#34;: -111.86816435821093 }, \u0026#34;weightCapacity\u0026#34;: 20, \u0026#34;remainingWeightCapacity\u0026#34;: 18.2923904630732, \u0026#34;pieceCapacity\u0026#34;: 8, \u0026#34;remainingPieceCapacity\u0026#34;: 7, \u0026#34;routes\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;_id\u0026#34;: 1, \u0026#34;routeFromGoogle\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;distance\u0026#34;: 0.02248501759660298, \u0026#34;startLoc\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;lat\u0026#34;: 40.73726833204571, \u0026#34;long\u0026#34;: -111.86816435821093 }, \u0026#34;endLoc\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;lat\u0026#34;: 40.73287234594392, \u0026#34;long\u0026#34;: -111.84611325115227 }, \u0026#34;nearPacketsDistance\u0026#34;: [ -1 ], \u0026#34;state\u0026#34;: 1 }, { \u0026#34;_id\u0026#34;: 3, \u0026#34;routeFromGoogle\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;distance\u0026#34;: 0.01372524844602735, \u0026#34;startLoc\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;lat\u0026#34;: 40.73287234594392, \u0026#34;long\u0026#34;: -111.84611325115227 }, \u0026#34;endLoc\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;lat\u0026#34;: 40.745843583374935, \u0026#34;long\u0026#34;: -111.84162666621344 }, \u0026#34;nearPacketsDistance\u0026#34;: [ -1 ], \u0026#34;state\u0026#34;: 1 } ], \u0026#34;packets\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;_id\u0026#34;: 0, \u0026#34;initLocation\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;lat\u0026#34;: 40.73287234594392, \u0026#34;long\u0026#34;: -111.84611325115227 }, \u0026#34;destLocation\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;lat\u0026#34;: 40.745843583374935, \u0026#34;long\u0026#34;: -111.84162666621344 }, \u0026#34;weight\u0026#34;: 1.707609536926801, \u0026#34;state\u0026#34;: 1, \u0026#34;courier\u0026#34;: {} } ] } ] /api/packet\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 [ { \u0026#34;_id\u0026#34;: 0, \u0026#34;initLocation\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;lat\u0026#34;: 40.73287234594392, \u0026#34;long\u0026#34;: -111.84611325115227 }, \u0026#34;destLocation\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;lat\u0026#34;: 40.745843583374935, \u0026#34;long\u0026#34;: -111.84162666621344 }, \u0026#34;weight\u0026#34;: 1.707609536926801, \u0026#34;state\u0026#34;: 1, \u0026#34;courier\u0026#34;: {} } ] /api/route\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 [ { \u0026#34;_id\u0026#34;: 0, \u0026#34;routeFromGoogle\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;distance\u0026#34;: 0.027888779677731172, \u0026#34;startLoc\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;lat\u0026#34;: 40.73726833204571, \u0026#34;long\u0026#34;: -111.86816435821093 }, \u0026#34;endLoc\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;lat\u0026#34;: 40.745843583374935, \u0026#34;long\u0026#34;: -111.84162666621344 }, \u0026#34;nearPacketsDistance\u0026#34;: [ -1 ], \u0026#34;state\u0026#34;: 0 }, { \u0026#34;_id\u0026#34;: 1, \u0026#34;routeFromGoogle\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;distance\u0026#34;: 0.02248501759660298, \u0026#34;startLoc\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;lat\u0026#34;: 40.73726833204571, \u0026#34;long\u0026#34;: -111.86816435821093 }, \u0026#34;endLoc\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;lat\u0026#34;: 40.73287234594392, \u0026#34;long\u0026#34;: -111.84611325115227 }, \u0026#34;nearPacketsDistance\u0026#34;: [ -1 ], \u0026#34;state\u0026#34;: 1 }, { \u0026#34;_id\u0026#34;: 2, \u0026#34;routeFromGoogle\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;distance\u0026#34;: 0, \u0026#34;startLoc\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;lat\u0026#34;: 40.73287234594392, \u0026#34;long\u0026#34;: -111.84611325115227 }, \u0026#34;endLoc\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;lat\u0026#34;: 40.73287234594392, \u0026#34;long\u0026#34;: -111.84611325115227 }, \u0026#34;nearPacketsDistance\u0026#34;: [ -1 ], \u0026#34;state\u0026#34;: 0 }, { \u0026#34;_id\u0026#34;: 3, \u0026#34;routeFromGoogle\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;distance\u0026#34;: 0.01372524844602735, \u0026#34;startLoc\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;lat\u0026#34;: 40.73287234594392, \u0026#34;long\u0026#34;: -111.84611325115227 }, \u0026#34;endLoc\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;lat\u0026#34;: 40.745843583374935, \u0026#34;long\u0026#34;: -111.84162666621344 }, \u0026#34;nearPacketsDistance\u0026#34;: [ -1 ], \u0026#34;state\u0026#34;: 1 } ] Route Optimization Firstly, every courier has a route to common destination point. Then most efficient package route change apply. It\u0026rsquo;s calculated with change of route distance according to package location. It will iterate until no package will left. But according to courier capacities, some of package can be over couriers\u0026rsquo; capacities; so you need to go second round.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 \u0026#34;dependencies\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;body-parser\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;~1.18.2\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;cookie-parser\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;~1.4.3\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;debug\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;~2.6.9\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;express\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;~4.15.5\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;mathjs\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;^3.20.2\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;point-line-distance\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;^1.0.0\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;google_directions\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;^0.6.0\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;polyline\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;^0.2.0\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;request\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;^2.83.0\u0026#34; } ","permalink":"https://mozanunal.com/2018/04/getir-hackhathon/","summary":"\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is a project developed for BiTaksi Getir Hackathon 2018.

Bu yıl itibariyle son 3 tanesine ben de katılmış bulunuyorum. Hatta geçen sene yarışma hakkında bir yazı da yazmıştım. Bu geleneği bu yıl da devam ettirmeye karar verdım.\nBu seneki yarışmada çok başarılı olamadık derece anlamında. Ama yarışmada çalışan, puan alabilen bir çözüm sunmak bile baya zor. O nedenle ben de çözümüzü birazcık açıklamak istiyorum. Aşağıdan direk github reposunu inceleyebilirsiniz. Github Repo\nYarışmada şunu yapmamız istendi: Belli bir zamanda bir yerden bir yere gitmesi gereken yolcular var. Elimizde yolcuları taşımak üzere arabalar var.

Buradaki en kritik fonksiyon \u0026ldquo;findRide\u0026rdquo; fonksiyonu. Biz çözümümüzü şu şekilde tasarladık: Simulasyon benzeri bir şey çalıştırıyoruz t = 0 anından başlanarak tüm arabalara ilk konumlarına ve \u0026ldquo;Ride\u0026rdquo; durumuna göre iş atanıyor. Sonra simulasyon t = 1 anına geçiyor. Eğer boşa çıkmış araba varsa tekrar ona iş atayım sonraki t anına geçiş yapıyor. Bu şekilde zamanı simüle etmiş oluyoruz ve boşa çıkan arabaya hemen iş atanıyor.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 import numpy as np from mapH import * class Car(object): def __init__(self,id): self.id = id self.currentPos = Point(0,0) self.rides = [] self.willBeIdleTime = 0 def printCar(self): print \u0026#34;-----Car id: \u0026#34;, self.id print \u0026#34;-pos \u0026#34;, self.currentPos.x, self.currentPos.y print \u0026#34;-status: \u0026#34;, self.status print \u0026#34;-rides\u0026#34;, self.rides def findRide(self, Rides, stepNow): costs = [] costs_rides = [] for ride in Rides: if ride.status is 0: stepCost = calcStep(self.currentPos, ride.start_intersection) if ( stepNow+(stepCost+ride.stepSize) ) \u0026lt; ride.latest_finish: if (stepNow+stepCost) \u0026gt; ride.earliest_start: # direk al git costs.append(stepCost) costs_rides.append(ride) else: # beklemeli cost costs.append(ride.earliest_start-stepNow) costs_rides.append(ride) if len(costs) \u0026gt; 0: darr = np.array(costs) selected_ride = costs_rides[darr.argmin()] self.rides.append(selected_ride.id) Rides[selected_ride.id].status = 1 self.willBeIdleTime = stepNow+(stepCost+ride.stepSize) else: self.willBeIdleTime = 1000000 Son olarak ana giriş dosyamız. Bu kod ile gerekli veri verilen dataset dosyalarından okunuyor ve kurguladığımız sisteme uygun hale getirilip objeler oluşturuluyor. Daha sonrasında önceden bahsettiğim simülasyon kısmı çalıştırılıyor ve çıktıları çıkış dosyasına yazılıyor yarışma tarafından verilen formatta. Evet bu yazı için benden bu kadar. Eğer anlamadığınız merak ettiğiniz yerler var ise kodla alakalı sorabilirsiniz. Son sözlerim olarak bu yarışmayı herkese tavsiye ediyorum. Gerçekten zorlayıcı ve geliştirici bir yarışma.

Şüphesiz bu hızlı gelişmenin mimarı Arduino. Atmelin 8 bitlik işlemcilerini temel alarak tasarlanan bu kart ve programala dili sayesinde insanlar kolayca projeler geliştirmeye ve hobi uygulamaları yapmaya başladılar. Ama Arduinonun ve hatta daha iyi bir mikroişlemcinin de yeterli olmadığı projeler var. Böyle bir ihtiyaç doğduğunda seçenekler kendini geliştirmek isteyenler için çok sıkıntılı hale geliyor. Önceki yazılarımdan birinde STM32 öğrenmeye nasıl başlanır ve proje nasıl oluşturulur onu anlatmıştım. Bu sefer mikroişlemcinin yanı sıra bir fpga üzerine gitmek istiyorum. Mesela yüksek hesaplama gücü ve paralel işlem gerektiren proje yapmak istiyorsunuz ve fgpa öğrenmek istiyorsunuz. Nasıl başlayabilirsiniz onu anlatmak istiyorum.\nGeliştirme Kartı Seçimi İlkönce geliştirme kartımızdan bahsedeyim. Ben üzerinde Cyclone IV bulunan Altera(Artık Intel oldu) marka bir kart seçtim. İlk nedenim maliyet. Usb blasterıyla birlikte oldukça uygun fiyatlara( 22$) alabiliyorsunuz. Fpgaler mikroişlemciler göre oldukça pahalı malzemeler o yüzden böyle bir başlangıç yapmak istedim. Diğer bir avantajı da bence geliştirme ortamının(Quartus) daha hafif olması ve lite sürümünde lisans prolemi yaşamadan kullanabilinmesidır. Xillinx fpgaleri hem ISEde hem VIVADOda kullandım. Geliştirme ortamları oldukça ağır ve ayarlama süreçleri daha sancılı geldi bana. Tabi bu konu malesef çok tecrübeli olduğum bir konu değil. Mesela büyük ve karmaşık projelerde daha büyük kolaylıklar sağlıyor olabilir. Bir diğer dezavantaj da geliştirme kartının üzerinde 2 buton ve 1 ledden başka direk kullanabileceğimiz ekipmanlar yok. Fakat elimizde bir sürü gpio var, her türlü sensörü biraz uğraşarak bağlamamız mümkün o yüzden bu durumu büyük bir problem olarak görmüyorum.\nFpga Kartı Usb Blaster Bağlantılar Fpga kartını aşağıdaki gibi bağlamalıyız. Bunun için bilgisayarımızda 2 adet usb portu olması gerekir. İlk port güç için kullanılıyor. İkinci port da jtag olarak kullanılıyor; buradan kod yükleme, debug gibi operasyonları gerçekleştirebiliriz.\nAşağıda ise geliştirme kartının pin bağlantılarını bulabilirsiniz. Bunu aliexpressden kopyaladım. Çok güvenilir bi kaynak değil ama pinleri kontrol ettim problem yok. Proje oluşturma Bu bölümde Quartus Prime kullanarak nasıl proje oluşturacağımızı anlatacağım. Aşağıdaki ekran açılış ekranı. Burdan yeni proje oluşturmayı seçiyoruz.\nProjemizi oluşrutulacağı dosya dizini ve ismini seçiyoruz.\nProje tipi olarak boş proje seçiyoruz.\nBurada Fpga kartımızın üzerindeki chipseti seçmemiz gerekir. Bu karttaki çipsetin tam ismi Cyclone IV EPCE6E22C8. Çipin üzerinden direk okuyabilirsiniz.\nMalesef Eda toolarıyla veya simülasyonla alakalı bir tecrübem olmadı henüz o yüzden boş bıraktım buraları.\nBu proje oluşturma için son adımdı. Seçimlerimizle alakalı bir özet sayfası.\nHello World Bildiğiniz gibi programlama dillerinde veya elektronik kartlarda ilk çalıştırılan koda-uygulamaya \u0026ldquo;Hello World\u0026rdquo; uygulaması denir. Biz de hello world uygulaması olarak and gate yapacağız.\nSol tarafta projedeki dosyaların ve modullerin hiyararşik dizilimini inceleyebilirsiniz. Proje geliştirme esnasında burası ile çok fazla haşır neşir olacaksınız. Devamında projeye bir verilog dosyası ekleyebiliriz.\nOluşturulan dosya \u0026ldquo;top module\u0026rdquo; olarak seçilmelidir. Aşağıdaki verilog kodları yazıldıktan sonra üçgen mavi ok ile proje compile edilir. Peki compile aşamaları nelerdir derseniz:\nİlkönce tariflediğimiz hardware\u0026rsquo;ın şeması oluşturulur. O şema lutlar ile ve fpga üzerine uygulanabilecek hale getirilir. Oluşturulan yeni şema fpga üzerinde bi yerlere oturtulur. Bu işleme routing denir. Son olarak binary dosya oluşturulur. Sol alt kısımda görüldüğü gibi bütün işlemler yeşil olmalıdır. Yoksa kodunuzda bir problem var demektir. Bu arada kodu derlemen önce \u0026ldquo;Pin Planner\u0026rdquo; aracı kullanarak \u0026ldquo;top_module\u0026quot;deki giriş çıkışları gerçek pinlere bağlamak gerekir. Ben burada 2 butonu and kapısının girişlerine, ledi ise and kapısının çıkışına bağladım. Projenin derleme raporunun bir kısmı aşağıdaki gibidir. Sonra \u0026ldquo;programmer\u0026rdquo; açılır. Usb blaster göremezse sürücülerinin güncellemesi gerekir. Eğer sürücü problemi yoksa Usb Blasterı otomatik gözükecektir. Son olarak start tuşuna bastığımızda kodu fpgaye yükleyecektir. Daha sonrasınd \u0026ldquo;key1\u0026rdquo; ve \u0026ldquo;key2\u0026rdquo; butonlarını kullanarak kodu test edebilirsiniz. Bu yazı için anlatacaklarım bu kadar. Projemizle fpga dünyasına hızlı bir giriş yapmış olduk. Hem de oldukça uygun fiyatlı bir paket ile. Umarım bu tarz cihazların kullanımı hobi elektroniğinde ve elektronik eğitiminde hızla artar.

Aslında genel olarak crypto currency son zamanlarda çok popüler. Peki nedir bu kavramlar? Crypto currency güvenliği şifreleme teknojileriyle sağlanan sanal para birimleridir. Her gün bir yeni bir tür crypto currency ortaya çıkıyor. Bunlar arasında en geçerli olanı ise bitcoin. Sanırım popülerliği en eskilerinden biri olmasından ve anlık olarak üretimi sınırlayabilen ilki olmasından geliyor. Bahsetmek istediğim 3. kavram ise bit coin mining: Yüksek hesaplama gücü kullanarak bitcoin üretebilmeniz mümkün. Bitcoin alışverişlerinin geçerli olması için bir şifre ile onaylanması gerekiyor. Bu şifreyi de bir hash çözerek oluşturuyorsunuz ve bunun karşılığında sistem sizi bitcoin ile ödüllendiriyor. Bu amaçla bir sürü insan sağlan ekran kartları alıp bitcoin tarlaları kurdular ve bu işten para kazanıyorlar. Tabi aklınıza, bitcoinin dünyaya katkısı nedir ya da ne kadar riskli, yatırım yapılır mı? gibi türlü türlü farklı açılardan sorular gelebilir. Ama malesef ben bu konuda uzman değilim ve daha nedir sorusuna bile tam olarak cevap vermek çok zor.\nNeyse konuyu biraz fazla dağıttım bu yazının konusu aslında bunlar değil. Konuma dönecek olursam; bitcoin mining işini kolaylaştıran sistem var, adı Nice Hash. Programını kuruyorsunuz ve bilgisayarınızın hesaplama gücünü satarak para kazanıyorsunuz. Arka planda o crypto currency\u0026rsquo;lerden en karlı olanı \u0026ldquo;mine\u0026rdquo; ediyor. Size de ona göre bir para ödüyor tabi bitcoin olarak. Bir arkadaşım da bu mining işine girdi. Projemin asıl amacı ona anlık olarak kazandığı parayı gösterebilecek bir sistem yapmaktı. Proje böyle başladı yani :). Bu projede kapsamında yaptığım; gerçek zamanlı olarak bu programın web apisini kullanarak bir miner\u0026rsquo;ın kazandığı parayı ve o andaki bitcoin kurunu çekip 1 inchlik oled ekranda gösteren bir sistem.\nBu proje ESP8266 modülleri kullanarak gerçekleştirildi. Bildiğiniz üzere minik bir wifi modulü. Bitcoin idnizi girerek yazdığım kodu derlerseniz direk olarak bilgilerinize ulaşabilirsiniz. ESP8266 minik bir oled ekranı kontrol ederek aldığı anlık kur datasını, kullanıcının toplam bitcoinini ve dolar karşılığını gösterecek şekilde bir program geliştirildi. ESP8266 olarak wemos d1 mini modullerinden kullandım. I2C pinlerini Oled ekrana den gelecek şekilde bir pertinanks oluşturdum uygun pinleri de lehimleyerek shield haline getirmiş oldum. Yukarıdaki fotoğrafta ESP8266 tamamen shieldın altına gizlenmiş halde bu sayede sistem baya toplanmış oldu tek parça bir görüntü kazandı.\nKod Kodu buradan inceleyebilirsiniz.\nWifi bağlanma ve ekran ayarları Wifi multi kullandığım için birden fazla wifi girebilirsiniz. Hangisi çevrede varsa onu kullanarak internete çıkar. Ekranın boyutu çok küçük olmasına rağmen çözünürlüğü böyle bir sisteme göre oldukça yüksek bu sayede baya hoş gözüküyor.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 //Setup Oled display.init(); display.flipScreenVertically(); display.setFont(ArialMT_Plain_16); display.setTextAlignment(TEXT_ALIGN_LEFT); display.clear(); //Setup Wifi WiFiMulti.addAP( ssid_1 , pass_1); WiFiMulti.addAP( ssid_2 , pass_2); display.clear(); display.drawString(0 , 20, \u0026#34;Waiting for wifi...\u0026#34;); display.display(); int xpos = 0; while(WiFiMulti.run() != WL_CONNECTED) { display.drawString(xpos ,40 , \u0026#34;.\u0026#34;); xpos= xpos + 3; display.display(); delay(500); } Gerekli verilerin internetten çekilmesi Data alma kısmında buradaki Nice Hash api dökumanından yararlandım. Bitcoin id ile http request yapıldığında geriye bir json dönüyor. Json Arduinojson library ile parçalanıp içinden gerekli bilgi çekiliyor. Verilen urlden datayı string almak için aşağıdaki fonksiyonu yazdım.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 String getJsonFromUrl(char *url) { HTTPClient http; //Declare an object of class HTTPClient String payload; http.begin(url); //Specify request destination int httpCode = http.GET(); //Send the request Serial.print(\u0026#34;\\n Received http code \u0026#34;); Serial.println(httpCode); if (httpCode \u0026gt; 0) //Check the returning code { Serial.println(\u0026#34;HTTP OK\u0026#34;); payload = http.getString(); //Get the request response payload Serial.println(payload); //Print the response payloa return payload; } else { Serial.println(\u0026#34;HTTP ERROR\u0026#34;); return \u0026#34;{}\u0026#34;; } http.end(); //Close connection } Kur bilgisinin alınması Yukarıdaki data alma fonksiyonu kullanılarak data string olarak çekilip json\u0026rsquo;a dönüştürülüyor. Daha sonrasında kur bilgisi aşağıdaki fonksiyon kullanılarak çekiliyor. Json parçalanıp içindeki \u0026ldquo;USD\u0026rdquo; objesinin \u0026ldquo;last\u0026rdquo; değikeni çekiliyor. Bizim için güncel bitcoin kuru.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 double getCurrency() { JsonObject\u0026amp; root_Currency = jsonBuffer_Currency.parseObject( getJsonFromUrl(url_Currency) ); if (root_Currency.success()) { double currency = root_Currency[\u0026#34;USD\u0026#34;][\u0026#34;last\u0026#34;]; return currency; } else { return 0.0; } } Kazanılan bitcoin bilgisinin alınması Kaznılan bitcoin için NiceHash Api kullanılıyor.

Aslında genel olarak crypto currency son zamanlarda çok popüler. Peki nedir bu kavramlar? Crypto currency güvenliği şifreleme teknojileriyle sağlanan sanal para birimleridir. Her gün bir yeni bir tür crypto currency ortaya çıkıyor. Bunlar arasında en geçerli olanı ise bitcoin. Sanırım popülerliği en eskilerinden biri olmasından ve anlık olarak üretimi sınırlayabilen ilki olmasından geliyor. Bahsetmek istediğim 3. kavram ise bit coin mining: Yüksek hesaplama gücü kullanarak bitcoin üretebilmeniz mümkün. Bitcoin alışverişlerinin geçerli olması için bir şifre ile onaylanması gerekiyor. Bu şifreyi de bir hash çözerek oluşturuyorsunuz ve bunun karşılığında sistem sizi bitcoin ile ödüllendiriyor. Bu amaçla bir sürü insan sağlan ekran kartları alıp bitcoin tarlaları kurdular ve bu işten para kazanıyorlar. Tabi aklınıza, bitcoinin dünyaya katkısı nedir ya da ne kadar riskli, yatırım yapılır mı? gibi türlü türlü farklı açılardan sorular gelebilir.

Son olarak bu sonuç dosyaları Google\u0026rsquo;ın sistemine yükleniyor ve skor hesaplanıyor. Yarışma 2 aşamadan oluşuyor 1. aşama online eleme. İkinci aşama ise ilk 30\u0026rsquo;a giren gruplar bir merkezde yarışıyor. Ben de yarışmaya 2016 ve 2017 yıllarında katıldım. Bu yazıda 2017 yılındaki online eleme sorusu ve pratik sorusu hakkında paylaşımlar yapmak istiyorum. Bu arada bu soruları 4 saat içerisinde çözememiz gerekiyor bu nedenle kodlar hızlı yazıldı hata içerebilir fakat her iki kod da google\u0026rsquo;ın sisteminde oldukça iyi puanlar alıyordu.\n*Yarışmada yazdığımız çözümlere yarışma sorularına ve örnek datalara bu bağlantıdan ulaşabilirsiniz * Pratik Sorusu: Pizza İlk soru \u0026ldquo;Pizza\u0026rdquo; sorusu. Bu soruda bir pizzayı istenilen maddelerden en az içerek şekilde parçalamamız isteniyor. Amaç pizzanın mümkün olduğunca fazla kısmını kullanmak. Pizzamız dikdörtgen ve ilk kısımda pizza sınıfı oluşturuluyor. Bunun için dosyadan ilk satır okunuyor ve bu satır, sütun ve içerik bilgisi dosyadan \u0026lsquo;parse\u0026rsquo; edilip sınıfıun özellikleri olarak bir matrise kopyalanıyor. Kodun devamında ise belirlenen özelliklerde dilimler oluşturmak üzerine. Dilim geçerli bir dilim mi? Dilim içerisindeki domates, mantar sayısı kaç şeklinde sorulara cevap veren methodlar var. Dilim hakkında verileri alan fonksiyonlar eklendikten sonra algoritmayı oluşturduk. Amacı en köşeden başlayarak gerekli dilimi oluşturduktan sonra sonraki dilime geçiyor. Daha sonra ikinci bir tur atıp genişletilebilecek dilimlere göz atıyor. Ve eğer dilim genişletilebilir durumdaysa genişletiyor pizzanın daha büyük bir kısmını kullanabilmek için. \u0026lsquo;Commit\u0026rsquo; fonksiyonu ile de değişlikler matrise kaydediliyor. Böylece zaten kullanımda olan parçalar diğer dilimlerde kullanılamıyor. İkinci tur dolaşımda anlık olarak o dilimi \u0026lsquo;decommit\u0026rsquo; yapıp o çevrede daha büyük bir dilim oluşturmaya çalışıyor. Son olarak başarı oranını hesaplayan bir fonksiyon var. Eğer algoritma üzerinde değişiklik yaparsanız bu fonksiyonu kullanarak performansını deneyebilirsiniz.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 114 115 116 117 118 119 120 121 122 123 124 125 126 127 128 129 130 131 132 133 134 135 136 137 138 139 140 141 class pizza: def __init__(self, file): f = open(file, \u0026#39;r\u0026#39;) fline = f.readline() [R, C, L, H] = fline.split(\u0026#39; \u0026#39;) self.L = int(L) self.H = int(H) self.R = int(R) self.C = int(C) self.Matrix = [] self.Matrix2 = [] self.result = [] self.resultS = [] for index, line in enumerate(f): self.Matrix.append([]) self.Matrix2.append([]) for i in range(0, self.C): self.Matrix[index].append(line[i]) self.Matrix2[index].append(False) def calculate(self): # print(\u0026#39;Calculating\u0026#39;) for i in range(0, self.R): for j in range(0, self.C): if self.Matrix2[i][j] is False: self.trycreateSlice(i, j) for index,curSlice in enumerate(self.result): self.decommitResult(curSlice) for i in [3,2,1,0]: for j in [3,2,1,0]: trySlice = slice(curSlice.r1, curSlice.c1, curSlice.r2 + i, curSlice.c2 + j) if self.testSlice(trySlice) is True: #print \u0026#39;updated\u0026#39; self.result[index].r1 = trySlice.r1 self.result[index].c1 = trySlice.c1 self.result[index].r2 = trySlice.r2 self.result[index].c2 = trySlice.c2 for i in range(trySlice.r1, trySlice.r2 + 1): for j in range(trySlice.c1, trySlice.c2 + 1): self.Matrix2[i][j] = True break def trycreateSlice(self, r, c): # print(r,c),\u0026#39;start\u0026#39; for i in range(0, 15): for j in range(0, 15): trySlice = slice(r, c, r + i, c + j) if self.testSlice(trySlice) is True: # print \u0026#39;finded\u0026#39; self.commitResult(trySlice) break return (r, c) def testSlice(self, slice): test = False if (((slice.r2 - slice.r1 + 1) * (slice.c2 - slice.c1 + 1)) \u0026gt; self.H) | ((slice.r2 + 1) \u0026gt; self.R) | ((slice.c2 + 1) \u0026gt; self.C): # print \u0026#39;\u0026gt;boundries\u0026#39; a = 5 else: tNum, mNum = self.getNumbers(slice) avaible = self.getAvaible(slice) if avaible is True: if(mNum \u0026gt;= self.L) \u0026amp; (tNum \u0026gt;= self.L): test = True else: # print \u0026#39;not Avaible\u0026#39; a = 5 return test def getAvaible(self, slice): avaible = True for i in range(slice.r1, slice.r2 + 1): for j in range(slice.c1, slice.c2 + 1): if self.Matrix2[i][j] == True: avaible = False return avaible def getNumbers(self, slice): tNum = 0 mNum = 0 for i in range(slice.r1, slice.r2 + 1): for j in range(slice.c1, slice.c2 + 1): if self.Matrix[i][j] == \u0026#39;T\u0026#39;: tNum += 1 elif self.Matrix[i][j] == \u0026#39;M\u0026#39;: mNum += 1 return tNum, mNum def commitResult(self, slice): self.result.append(slice) # print \u0026#39;done\u0026#39;,str(r1)+\u0026#34; \u0026#34;+str(c1)+\u0026#34; \u0026#34;+str(r2)+\u0026#34; \u0026#34;+str(c2) for i in range(slice.r1, slice.r2 + 1): for j in range(slice.c1, slice.c2 + 1): self.Matrix2[i][j] = True def decommitResult(self, slice): # print \u0026#39;done\u0026#39;,str(r1)+\u0026#34; \u0026#34;+str(c1)+\u0026#34; \u0026#34;+str(r2)+\u0026#34; \u0026#34;+str(c2) for i in range(slice.r1, slice.r2 + 1): for j in range(slice.c1, slice.c2 + 1): self.Matrix2[i][j] = False def convertRestultString(self): for slice in self.result: self.resultS.append(str(slice.r1) + \u0026#34; \u0026#34; + str(slice.c1) + \u0026#34; \u0026#34; + str(slice.r2) + \u0026#34; \u0026#34; + str(slice.c2)) def printSucces(self): trueC = 0 falseC = 0 for i in range(0, self.R): for j in range(0, self.C): if self.Matrix2[i][j] == True: trueC += 1 else: falseC += 1 print \u0026#34;Score: \u0026#34;, trueC, \u0026#34; / \u0026#34;, trueC+falseC class slice: def __init__(self,r1,c1,r2,c2): self.r1 = r1 self.c1 = c1 self.r2 = r2 self.c2 = c2 mypizza = pizza(\u0026#39;medium.in\u0026#39;) # print mypizza.Matrix # print mypizza.Matrix2 mypizza.calculate() mypizza.convertRestultString() s = str(len(mypizza.resultS))+\u0026#34;\\n\u0026#34; for res in mypizza.resultS: s += res + \u0026#34;\\n\u0026#34; file = open(\u0026#34;medium.txt\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;w\u0026#34;) file.write(s) file.close() mypizza.printSucces() Online eleme sorusu: Streaming Videos Bu soruda ise video izleme gecikmesini azaltmak için videoları \u0026lsquo;cache\u0026rsquo; sunuclara yerleştirmemiz isteniyor. Yüksek puan almak için toplam gecikme süresi minimum olmalı. Bu kapsam da ilk aşamada gerekli sınıflar oluşturuldu. Daha sonrasında bu sınıflar arasında bağlantılar oluşturuldu. Algoritmanın amacı herhangibir bir cache serverın bütün videoları için latency hesaplayıp sonra bunları skorlayarak bir optimizasyon yapmak. Burda tabi bağlantıları yapmak biraz zor oldu benim açımdan. Pizza sorusuyla karşılaştırınca çok daha fazla farklı sınıf olduğunu farketmişsiniz. Burda çözümü anlatmanın çok bir anlamı olmadığını düşünüyorum. Daha çok yarışma hakkında bir kaç izlenimimden bahsetmek isterim. Yarışmada farkettiğiniz üzere aslında tam olarak çözümü belli olmayan sorular soruluyor. Daha doğrusu mutlak doğru sonuç var ama onu hesaplamak imkansız bir seviyede. Yani Brute force ile neredeyse sonsuz olasılıkla karşı karşıya kaldığımız sorular soruluyor. Lütfen soruları çözerken hep onu dikkat alın. Sürekli algoritmanınızın karmaşıklığına dikkat ederek geliştirin. Ben de bu konuda yeterince tecrübeli olmadığım için bir kaç kere büyük data kümelerinde sonsuz işleme doğru giden algoritmalar yazdım. İkinci önerim ise kesinlikle verilen datalara bakarak çözümünüzü üretin. Çünkü bütün sorularda genelde 3 4 adet farklı data kümesi verilliyor ve genelde her bir data farklı bir şeyi ölçüyor. Biri için geliştirdiğiniz algoritma diğerlerine uymayabiliyor. Bugünlük bu kadar daha ayrıntılı sorularınızı her zaman sorabilirsiniz.

Yarışmanın ilk saatlerini konuya karar verme ve 24 saat boyunca neler yapacağımızı planlayarak geçti. Yarışmayı bir kaç senedir takip ediyoruz. Bu seneki \u0026ldquo;challenge\u0026quot;ları görünce biraz şaşırdık. Çünkü genellikle yer bilimleri üzerine ve veri işleme, anlamlandırmaya yönelik konulardı. Bizim takımımıza pek hitap etmediği için IOT tabanlı bir şeyler yapabileceğimiz aynı zamanda mekanik, elektronik dizayn yapabileceğimiz konular seçmeye çalıştık. Bu düşüncelerle * Let\u0026rsquo;s go to the Beach* konusunu seçtik. Bu kampsamda bulut tabanlı her bir kişinin ayrı ayrı, kişisel UV ışın alımını takip edip ona öneriler verebilen bir sistem mimarisi üzerine çalıştık. Sistemin ayrıntılarına yazının devamından ulaşabilirsiniz. Bu arada projemiz birincilik ödülüne layık görüldü. Bu da beni ayrıca çok mutlu etti. Proje ile alakalı sorunlarınız için ulaşabilirsiniz. Tekrar görüşmek üzere\nIt is a project developed for Nasa Space Apps Challenge 2017. Detailed information can be foud from below\nThe Challenge Let\u0026rsquo;s go to the Beach! Build a tool for beach-goers to monitor for hazards and to alert them of precautionary measures for protection on their swim- and surf-filled adventures!\nInternet Of Beach {% youtube psZvnp\u0026ndash;GZY %}\nSatisfy your curiosity about beaches to go! IoB wristband warns you about dangerous amounts of UV exposure with respect to your skin sensitivity, age and how much actual radiation you received.\nWe designed a web application, an IOB wristband a gateway and a server. With our web application, many information about the beach can be learned. Required informations are taken from openweather api and are showed to users with open board dashboard. The time of the UV exposure of the person is measured with IOT wristband. The required informations and energy are provided from solar panel. RGB leds warn you with processing data from the cloud. We also designed a gateway which is shaped as a buoy and placed it to the beaches to connect IOB wristband to cloud. More reliable data are obtained with processing all these data in cloud.\nTo view the presentation:\nTo view the full source code:\nTo view the photos and all other documents (PCBs, CAD files):\nWho Are We? We are participating the competition from Istanbul, TURKEY. All of us studying at Istanbul Technical Univercity.\nMurat Gokcen Aerospace Engineering Mehmet Ozan Unal Electronics and Communication Engineering Emir Can Yaman Aerospace Engineering Electornics and Communicatin Engineering Ertugrul Cinar Aeronautical Engineering Control and Automation Engineering It\u0026rsquo;s hard to introduce everybody one by one. But in a nutshell we are enthusiast about space, electronic, software and all flying things. Also two members of our team joinder at 2015 Nasa Space Apps Challange Istanbul and they were selected as People\u0026rsquo;s choice with Christopher\nWhat is The Challange? Let\u0026rsquo;s go to the Beach! According to the World Health Organization [1], overexposure to sunlight can cause harm to our skin, our eyes, and our immune systems. In fact, protecting ourselves from UV damage, for example by using hats, sunglasses, and sunscreen, can prevent four out of five cases of skin cancer.\nOur soution covers most of challange as below.\nPredict their sun exposure Suggest alternative times of the day, or days when sun exposure levels are lower Warn users of presence of HABs in local beaches, and direct them to safer regions, where available Add other precautionary and safety alerts as you see fit! What is The Solution? APP + IoT Band + Cloud!\nIoT Band\nGateway between IoT Band and Cloud Server Cloud Server How its Working? For better describition, you can watch project video.\nThank you for your time We are to happy to participate this contents. We hope we will join next year again. By the way, you can see technologies which we used while hackathon process.\nI want to finish with a quote from Richard Bronson.\nAbove all, we want to create something we\u0026rsquo;re proud of.\n[1] “Sun Protection.” Ultraviolet radiation and the INTERSUN Programme.

Yazıya başlamadan önce bu çalışmaların tamamını beraber yaptığım Bahadır Gökçeaslan teşekkür etmeyi bir borç bilirim.\nEvet otopilot aslında benim anlatacağım bölüme kıyasla biraz fazla geniş bir kavram oldu. Zira malesef proje uçuş kontrolcüsü aşamalarında kaldı. Bir soru ile başlayalım. Bir uçuş kontrolcüsü nedir? Bir uçuş kontrolcüsü temel olarak havada uçan bir aracın yere göre açılarının istenilen şekilde olmasını sağlayan sensör ve hareketli mekanizmalar bütünüdür. Aslında yere göre açılarla sınırlamak çok mantıklı değil. Bir hava aracının yükseliğinin sabit olması veya istenilen hızda istenilen konumda kalmasını sağlamak da bunun işidir. Fakat bu projede, bir Quadcopter uçuş kontrolcüsü olarak tasarlanmış olan bu yapıda amaç quadcopterin yere göre açılarını kumandadan gelen girdilere göre kontrol etmekti.\nPeki bu IMU açılar nasıl kontrol edilir? Hepinizin bildiği gibi bi quadcopter yere itki veren 4 adet motordan oluşan bir mekanizma. Ama bir quadcopteri havada tutmak göründüğü kadar kolay değildir. Basit olarak yapılan işlem quadcopter motorlanının hızını istenilen açıda kalacak şekilde kontrol etmektir. Bunun için de 2 temel yapı kullanılır. IMU denen bu açıları ölçen sensörler ve PID denilen kontrol algoritması. Bu noktada eğer bu kavramlar tanıdık gelmediyse imu hakkındakı şu yazımı ve pid hakkındaki bu yazımı okumanızı tavsiye ederim. Kodu inceleyecek olursanız projemizi belli parçalara ayırmış durumdayız. Bu parçalar şunlardır:\nKumandadan girdilerin alınması IMU açılarının güncellenmesi Girdi değerlerine ulaşmak için gerekli motor hızlarının pid algotirmasıyla hesaplanması Telemetri datasının yollanması Ben bu yazıda daha çok 3. madde üzerinde duracağım. Öncellikle bir eksende kontrolü ele alalım. Bir eksende kontrol için yapılması gereken işlem şöyledir:\nImu üzerinden şuanki açı ve ve kumandadan o eksen için istenen açı alınır. ( Otopilotlu bir yapıda istenen açıyı, verilen koordinata gitmek için kendisi hesaplar. ) Şu anki açı hatası Geçmişteki açı hatası toplamı Gelecekte oluşabilecek açı hatası tahmini Üsteki 3\u0026rsquo;ü kullanılarak hedef açı için gerekli açısal hız bulunur. Şuanki açısal hız hatası Geçmişsteki açısal hız hatası toplamı Gelecekte oluşabilecek açısal hata Üsteki 3\u0026rsquo;ü kullanılarak o eksen için pıd çıktısı hesaplanmış olur. Bu şekilde bir eksenin kontrolü için 2 katlı pid işlemi uygulamak gereklidir. Peki 3 eksenin için nasıl bir çözüm kullanmak gerekir. Bunu anlatmak yerine şu 4 satır kodu buraya eklemek istiyorum. (output_ ile başlayanların ilgili eksen ile alakalı pıd çıkışı olduğunu varsayın. )\nBu iki satır sayesinde toplam 6 pid kontrolcüsünden oluşturulan hesaplamalar birleştirilir. Birleştirme esnasındaki işaretlerin mantığını siz de farketmişsinizdir. O eksen için pid etkisi negatif mi pozitif mi? Yani o motorun hızının artması o eksende ne yönde bir hareket sağlar.\nEvet son olarak bizim projemizden bahsedeyim. Ortalıkta uzun yıllardır açık kaynaklı otopilotlar var biz de bunun farkında olmamıza rağmen kendimizi geliştirmek amacıyla bu projeye başladık. Malesef test düzeneklerine ve projenin geliştirilmesine daha sonrasında zaman ayıramadık. Ama dediğim gibi bu konuyla alakalı değerli tecrübelere edindiğimizi düşünüyorum. Belki günün birinde tamamlarız.\nYaptığımız çalışmaların tamamının linki: github.com/mozanunal/SimplePilot\nGenellikle arduino kütüphanelerini kullandığımız için bizim kodumuz performans açısından pek uygun olmadığını düşünüyorum. Ama şuradaki yazıda ardupilot kütüphanelerini kullanarak olayın temelini de anlatarak güzel bir yazı ortaya koymuş bir arkadaşımız var.

Zaman zaman projelerimizde 8 bitlik atmel veya pic işlemcilerin beklentiyi karşılamadığı oluyor. Böyle durumlar için ST Microelectronics firmasının STM32 isimli 32 bitlik işlemcilerini önerebilirim. 32 Bit işlemciler için en çok kaynak bulanabilecek işlemci takip ettiğim kadarıyla. ST firması çoğu gelişitme aracını da ücretsiz olarak sağlıyor. Bu yazıda tanıtacağım kartlar Arm Cortex M3 mimarisi tabanlı geliştirme kartlarıdır. Peki bu çekirdeği neden seçtim? Bir cümleyle özetlemek gerekirse 8 bitlik islemcilere bariz üstünlük sağlayan ve projelerin pek çoğu için yeterli özelliklere sahip olan en uygun fiyatlı işlemci. Geliştirme kartı olmadan sadece işlemci 1 - 2 dolar gibi çok iyi bir fiyata sahip. Özelliklerine aşağıdan ulaşabilirsiniz.\nEvet özellikler güzel peki nereden nasıl başlarım diyorsanız size bir kaç önerim var.\nBu girişi yapmak için gerekli malzemeler:\nSTM32F103C8T6 geliştirme kartı Stlink (Ya da FTDI üzerinden de kod yükleyebilirsiniz ama debug yapılmıyor) Gerekli programlar:\nSTM32CUBEMX SW4STM32 İlkönce malzemelerimizi inceleyelim:\n32 bitlik arm işlemcilerin ortak özelliği genellikle çok pinli ve küçük olmaları. Bu nedenle genellikle yüzey montaj teknolojisiyle lehimleniyor. Bu yüzden eğer sabit bir tasarımınız yoksa geliştirme yapacaksanız pinlerin denemeler icin dışarı çıkarıldığı geliştirme kartları kullanmak zorundasınız. Bu kartlar sayesinde pinlere rahatça erişebilir, genellikle üzerinde bulunan regülator, RTC, USB soketleri ve JTAG soketlerinin imkanlarından yararlanabilirsiniz.\nAşağıdaki linkten bendeki geliştirme kartının devre şemasına ulaşabilirsiniz.\nSTM32F103C8T6 Geliştirme Kartı\nhttps://www.openimpulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/wpsc/downloadables/STM32F103C8T6-Schematic-Diagram.pdf\nhttps://www.openimpulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/wpsc/downloadables/STM32F103C8T6-ARM-Development-Board-Cortex-M3-Datasheet.pdf\nhttps://www.openimpulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/wpsc/downloadables/MINI-STM32-Schematic-Diagram.pdf\nGeliştirme kartının biraz anlatmam gerekirse: Ana işlemcisi STM32F103C8T6 modeli Arm Cortex M3 tabanlı bir işlemcisi var. Neredeyse bütün pinleri kolayca ulaşılabilmesi için geliştirme kartında dışarı çıkarılmış. Ayrıca bir tane 8 Mhz, bir tane de 32khz kristal bağlanmış. Usb pinleri de uygun koruma dirençleri takılarak bir usb konnektörüne bağlanmış. Buradan hem usb üzerinden güç verilebiliyor hem de uygun programla usb üzerinden bilgisayar ile haberleşebiliriz. 3 adet jumper var bunları farklı yerlere takarak usb bağlantısını kesebiliyoruz, boot0 ve boot1 pinlerini ayarlayabiliyoruz. Kolayca reset atabilmek için bir adet butonumuz var ve güç olduğuni göstermek için bir adet ledimiz var.\n1. Adım : STM32CUBEMX Üzerinden Projenin Oluşturulması STM32CUBEMX ST firması tarafından geliştirilen görsel ayarlama programıdır. Bu program sayesinde işlemcimizi görsel olarak ayarlayabiliriz ve o ayarlara uygun projeyi farklı IDE seçenekleri için oluşturabiliriz. Oluşturulan projede HAL driver veya CMSIS kütüphanesi ayarlarıyla uğraşmamıza gerek kalmaz CubeMX hepsini projeye ekler.\nSTM32F103C8T6 işlemcisi seçilir.\nBizi karşalayan ekran böyle olacaktır. Buradan kullanmak istediğiniz \u0026ldquo;Çevresel Birimleri\u0026rdquo; seçip ayarlarını yapabiliriz. Örneğin Uart birimini aktifleştirip baud rate\u0026rsquo;ini 9600 olarak seçebiliriz. Hatta Uart RX için çalışan bir DMA interrupt\u0026rsquo;ı oluşturabiliriz. Üstelik sadece bir kaç tık ile.\nGeliştirme boardu datasheetinden alınan devre şeması. CubeMX ayarlarken burdan yararlanılır.\nKristal bağlantıları uart ve usb bağlantıları aşağıdaki gibi ayarlanmıştır.\nÖrneğin usb ayarları aşağıdaki gibi yapılabilir.\nhttps://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/development-tools/software-development-tools/stm32-software-development-tools/stm32-utilities/stsw-stm32102.html\nUsb kullanmak istediğimizde Clock sorunun olacağını CubeMX önceden tahmin ettiği için uyarı veriyor.\nUsbye göre clock ayarları aşağıdaki gibi yapılabilir.\nHer şey tamamlandığına göre artık projemizi oluşturabiliriz. Bunu ise sadece \u0026ldquo;Generate Project\u0026rdquo; buttonuna basarak ve devamında istediğimiz IDE seçerek yapıyoruz. Kendisi işlemcimize uygun paketleri indirip kuruyor ve projeyi oluşturuyor.\n2. Adım : SW4STM32 IDE Üzerinden Programın Yazılması ve Karta Yüklenmesi Sonraki adım olarak yazılım geliştirilmesi ve kodun derlenip karta yüklenmesi veya debug edilmesi kalıyor. Ben bu aşamada SW4STM32 kullandım. Bunu kullanma sebebim açıkcası öğrenmek istemem. Çünkü bu IDE açık kaynak kodlu Eclipse IDE üzerine geliştirilmiş bir IDE ve CubeMX tarafından destekeleniyor.

It is possible to use 4 different algorithm and 3 different source(Camera, Video, Image) in this program. Most of the tryings have been made using LFW data set which have 13000 pictures of 1500 different people.Details of project can be reached below:\nSource Code: https://github.com/mozanunal/PassFace\n{% youtube d6LI42NEZZY? %}\n1. Introduction Definition of the Problem In this project, a program is going to develop to recognize the faces and compare them the faces it learned and give the identity of the person. All this identifying system is going to work in real time. Main subjects in this project are image processing and machine learning. Project aim to develop some algorithm to detect faces specifically recognize the faces using pattern recognition algorithms. The number of faces and the equipment needed is going to be determined according to test of different algorithms.\nMotivation To detect identity of person from images is very beneficial subject. It can provide easy access to users. It can be used for detect criminals and prevent potential crimes. Also I see this subject in a lot of industrial projects and academic researches. I want to work with real world problem and problem which is not completely solved. Therefore I decided to work with this project.\nDifficulties of Problem Main difficulties can be sorted like below:\nFaces are not completely rigid objects so it is hard to recognize them. The more person in database needs more and more processing power. Blurry images because of real time system The effects of ambient light Changes in person’s face over time Data Sets AT\u0026amp;T Facedatabase\nThe AT\u0026amp;T Face Database, sometimes also referred to as ORL Database of Faces, contains ten different images of each of 40 distinct subjects. For some subjects, the images were taken at different times, varying the lighting, facial expressions (open / closed eyes, smiling / not smiling) and facial details (glasses / no glasses). All the images were taken against a dark homogeneous background with the subjects in an upright, frontal position (with tolerance for some side movement).\nYale Facedatabase A\nalso known as Yalefaces. The AT\u0026amp;T Face Database is good for initial tests, but it’s a fairly easy database. The Eigenfaces method already has a 97% recognition rate on it, so you won’t see any great improvements with other algorithms. The Yale Face Database A (also known as Yalefaces) is a more appropriate dataset for initial experiments, because the recognition problem is harder. The database consists of 15 people (14 male, 1 female) each with 11 grayscale images sized 320x243 pixel. There are changes in the light conditions (center light, left light, right light), facial expressions (happy, normal, sad, sleepy, surprised, wink) and glasses (glasses, no-glasses).\nLabeled Faces in the Wild\nA database of face photographs designed for studying the problem of unconstrained face recognition. The data set contains more than 13,000 images of faces collected from the web. Each face has been labeled with the name of the person pictured. 1680 of the people pictured have two or more distinct photos in the data set. The only constraint on these faces is that they were detected by the Viola-Jones face detector..\nProgramming Environment and Libraries Visual Studio IDE is used for project. The program is written in C# using OpenCV libraries.\n2. Face Recognition Algorithm Face Detection Face Detection is not the main subject of this project but to create database and to increase the face recognition performance. Opencv’s Haar Cascade Classifier function is used. In this function a haar cascade file ,which is pre learned for face detection, is used.\nMorphologic Operations Ambient light and the movement at faces are the challenging problems in face recognition. Therefore some morphologic operators is applied to the faces to decrease the effect of these problems. In this project equalize histogram function of opencv is used to decrease the effect of the ambient light.\nSURF Feature Extractor 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 if (comboBoxAlgorithm.Text == “SURF Feature Extractor”) { string dataDirectory=Directory.GetCurrentDirectory()+”\\TrainedFaces”; string[] files = Directory.GetFiles(dataDirectory, “*.jpeg”, SearchOption.AllDirectories); foreach (var file in files) { richTextBox1.Text += file.ToString(); long recpoints; ImagesampleImage = new Image(file); secondImageBox.Image = sampleImage; using (Image modelImage = sampleImage.Convert()) using (Image observedImage = image.Convert()) { Image result = SurfRecognizer.Draw(modelImage, observedImage, out recpoints); //captureImageBox.Image = observedImage; if (recpoints \u0026gt; 10) { MCvFont f = new MCvFont(Emgu.CV.CvEnum.FONT.CV_FONT_HERSHEY_COMPLEX, 1.0, 1.0); result.Draw(“Person Recognited, Welcome”, ref f, new Point(40, 40), new Bgr(0, 255, 0)); ImageViewer.Show(result, String.Format(“ {0} Points Recognited”, recpoints)); } } } Eigenfaces 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 else if (comboBoxAlgorithm.Text == \u0026#34;EigenFaces\u0026#34;) { //image._EqualizeHist(); if (eqHisChecked.Checked == true) { image._EqualizeHist(); } var result = eigenFaceRecognizer.Predict(image.Convert().Resize(100, 100, Emgu.CV.CvEnum.INTER.CV_INTER_CUBIC)); if (result.Label != -1) { image.Draw(eigenlabels[result.Label].ToString(), ref font, new Point(face.X - 2, face.Y - 2), new Bgr(Color.LightGreen)); label6.Text = result.Distance.ToString(); } } Fisherfaces 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 else if (comboBoxAlgorithm.Text == \u0026#34;FisherFaces\u0026#34;) { if (eqHisChecked.Checked == true) { image._EqualizeHist(); } var result = fisherFaceRecognizer.Predict(image.Convert().Resize(100, 100, Emgu.CV.CvEnum.INTER.CV_INTER_CUBIC)); if (result.Label != -1) { image.Draw(fisherlabels[result.Label].ToString(), ref font, new Point(face.X - 2, face.Y - 2), new Bgr(Color.LightGreen)); label6.Text = result.Distance.ToString(); } } Local Binary Patterns Histograms 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 else if (comboBoxAlgorithm.Text == \u0026#34;LBPHFaces\u0026#34;) { if (eqHisChecked.Checked == true) { image._EqualizeHist(); } var result = lbphFaceRecognizer.Predict(image.Convert().Resize(100, 100, Emgu.CV.CvEnum.INTER.CV_INTER_CUBIC)); if (result.Label != -1) { image.Draw(lbphlabels[result.Label].ToString(), ref font, new Point(face.X - 2, face.Y - 2), new Bgr(Color.LightGreen)); label6.Text = result.Distance.ToString(); } } 3.

But the comparison of these algorithms is not finished. The next step is implementing this algorithm the compare the algorithms accuracy and performance truly.\nPerformance Optimizations For fix the performance problems, develop the program for multiple core CPUs. For better performance, develop the program to run over GPU using CUDA libraries.\nAlgorithm Optimizations In these days, the most improved face recognition algorithms are using 3D face recognition technologies. It is based on; the 3D model of the faces are created using different 2D images. Therefore, the angle of looking and the direction of light are no longer be problem for these algorithms. The recognize operations are implementing using Neural Networks and Deep Learning Algorithms. It is planning to implement latest algorithms to increase accuracy in different conditions.\n5. Conclusion In this project, the main principles of the face recognition algorithms are learned. The performances and accuracies of the algorithms are compared. A gui application is developed to create database and process images using selected algorithm.\n","permalink":"https://mozanunal.com/2016/06/passface-face-recognition-using-opencv/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHi,\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nPassFace is a face recognizing program develop using EmguCV (OpenCV wrapper).

Şu an devam edemiyorum çünkü lipo pillerim bitti ve şarj aletini malesef istanbulda unutmuşum. Neyse projemize geçelim.\nGerekli malzemeler 2 tane yüksek torklu, 1 tane daha düşük torklu 360 derece dönebilen servo, bir Arduino Nano, Bluetooth Modulü, Motor sürücü modüller bir Android Cep Telefonu kontrol için, mekanik kısım için kalın ataçlar ve bir adet dünya küre modeli (ana gövdemiz olarak).\nKabaca planladığım mekanik dizayn aşağıdaki gibi. açıklamak gerekirse \u0026ldquo;artı\u0026rdquo; şeklindeki mekanizmamız droidin kontrol edildiği ve tüm motoların bulunduğu yer. Ana küreye sadece kenarlardan motorlar aracılığıyla bağlı alt kısmına ise bir ağırlık bağlı metal bir parça olabilir ama kesinlikle bir disk olmasını öneririm. Benim bağladığım parça stabiliteye hiç iyi etki etmedi. Bu ağırlık sayesinde yan motorlar döndüğünde ağırlığın dönmesi daha zor olduğundan dışarıdaki küre dönmeye başlıyor bu sayede robotumuz ilerliyor. Üçüncü bir motorumuz ise o ağırlığı kendi ekseni etrafında döndürüyor. Momentumun korunumundan ağırlık kendi ekseni etrafında dönmeye başladığı anda küremiz de ters yönde kendi etrafında dönüyor. Kafa için ise mıknatıs kullanmayı düşünüyorum ama onları bölüm 2\u0026rsquo;de anlatacağım.\nProjemin şu anki halinin kısa bir tanıtım videosu :\nYapılışına geçecek olursak ilk önce model küremizi yerinden çıkarıp dışındaki harita kısmını soyuyoruz. Sonra ortadan ikiye ayırıyoruz. Maket bıçağı yardımıyla kolayca yapılabilecek bir işlem.\n2 adet 360 derece dönebilen servomuzu delikli pertinanks üzerine sabitliyoruz. Sağlamlığından emin olmak için plastik kelepçe kullanabiliriz. Servonun uçlarına kalın bir atacı şekillendirip takıyoruz. Penseyle küre kenarına göre şekillendirip bant ve sıcak silikon kullanarak kürenin kenarlarına sabitliyoruz. Ben devremi küçük bir pertinanks üzerine lehimledim. Devrede 1 adet Arduino Nano, 1 adet Bluetooth Modulü (HC-06), 1 adet motor sürücü devresi (Servolardan birini kontrol etmek için gerekli oldu 360 derece dönmesi için modifiye edince) ve yanlardaki 2 adet servoya da doğrudan bağlantı var. Devremi sabitlemeden önce pertinanksın altına ağırlığı taşıyacak bu sefer daha küçük bir servo sabitledim. Sabitlemek için plastik kelepçe bant kullandım. Sonra da devremi yukarı sabitledim.\nAğırlık olarak aşağıdaki kilit mekanizmasını kullandım ataç kullanarak onu alt taraftaki servoya monte ettim. Ama ağırlığımızın disk şeklinde olması gerekiyor sonraki versiyonda değiştireceğim.\nEn son olarak pili de ekleyince kürenin içinin son görüntüsü aşağıdaki gibi oldu.

Amacım haberleşme modülleri seçilirken kolayca karşılaştırmalar yapılabilecek basit bir hesaplama ortamı oluşturmaktı. Bu tarz işler için en uygun program olduğunu düşündüğüm Excel programını kullandım.\nÖncelikle bu hesabı anlamama şuradaki link çok yardımcı oldu. Öncelikle onu incelemenizi tavsiye ederim. Oradaki bilgileri kısaca özetleyecek olursam:\nİlk olarak mesafeyi temel olarak etkilen 2 kavram var. Birincisi vericinin çıkış gücü, ikincisi ise alıcının alış hassasiyeti. Özellikle 2. etken sık sık önemi unutulan konulardan biri. Genelde aktarılan veri akış hızının artmasıyla alış hassasiyeti düşmektedir. Yeterli olacak minimum veri akış hızını seçmek de önemli noktalardan bir tanesidir. Çıkış gücüne anten ve kuvvetlendirici kazançları da eklenir. Bulunan bu değere toplam güç denir. Hesabımızı belirleyen bağıntı ise şöyledir:\nAlış Hassasiyeti \u0026lt; Toplam güç – Yol Zayıflaması Kaybı Eğer burayı eşit olarak alırsak maksimum mesafeyi hesaplamış oluruz ama ideal ortam için hesaplarımızı yaptığımız için büyük bir hata payı koymanızı tavsiye ederim (gerçekçi sonuçlar için)\nŞimdilik ben bir hata payı eklemedim çünkü donanımdan ve kullanım şeklinden ve daha bir sürü şeyden çok değişebilir. Maksimum üzerinden devam edelim. Yol zayıflamasının maksimum değerini de aşağıdaki gibi elde etmiş oluruz.\nToplam güç (dBm) - Alış hassasiyeti (dBm) = Yol Zayıflaması (dB) Yol zayıflamasını kullanarak mesafe ise aşağıdaki gibi hesaplanır.\nYol Zayıflaması (dB) - 20.log10(Frekans, MHz) + 27.55 = 20.log10(Mesafe, Metre) Çok önemli uyarı: Yaptığımız bu hesapla ortaya çıkan sonuç en idael koşullar için geçerlidir. Neleri hesaba katmadığımızı şöyle sıralayabiliriz:\nÖncelikle yaptığımız hesap Line of sight mesafe hesabı aradaya girebilecek hiç bir engel hesaba katılmadı. ( Dağ, ağaç, direk,) Hesaplar boş uzay için yapıldı. Havanın etkisi ve hava olaylarının etkisi hiç hesaba katılmadı. Yakın frekanslardaki her sinyal mesafeyi kısaltıcı etki gösterecektir.

Birincisi vericinin çıkış gücü, ikincisi ise alıcının alış hassasiyeti. Özellikle 2. etken sık sık önemi unutulan konulardan biri. Genelde aktarılan veri akış hızının artmasıyla alış hassasiyeti düşmektedir. Yeterli olacak minimum veri akış hızını seçmek de önemli noktalardan bir tanesidir. Çıkış gücüne anten ve kuvvetlendirici kazançları da eklenir. Bulunan bu değere toplam güç denir.

Yapacağımız RC kumanda ile istediğiniz türde aracı, istediğiniz kadar kanalla kontrol etmeniz mümkün. Benim uygulamamda 2 adet 2 eksen joystick ve 1 potansiyometre bulunuyor. Yani 5 kanallı örnek bir uygulama yaptım. Öncelikle malzemelerden başlayalım.\nArduino Nano Nrf24l01 1 adet 10k potansiyometre 1 adet 10k direnç 2 adet 2 eksen joystick modulü Bu malzemelerle beraber toplam maliyetimiz 7- 8 dolar civarı oluyor. Maximum kullanım mesafesi ise 30 40 metre civarında hobi uygulamarına göre oldukça yeterli bir mesafe elde ediyoruz.\nBağlantılara gelecek olursak nrf24 modülü SPI ile çalışıyor. Arduino\u0026rsquo;nun uygun SPI pinlerine bağlıyoruz. Şemasını kolayca bulabilirsiniz. Joystick modulleri için de bir tanesi için 2 analog giriş olmak üzere Arduino Nanonun toplam 4 tane analog giriş pinin kullanıyoruz. Potansiyometrenin kullanımı için de 1 adet analog giriş pini kullanıyoruz.\nKumandanın koduyla alakalı olarak değinmek istediğim bir kaç nokta var. Baştaki ayarlarda nrf ile ilgili ayarlar yapılıyor. Bu modülle alakalı bir kaç önemli nokta şöyle:\nKanal seçimi çok önemli 2.4 ghz çok kullanılan bir frekans ve uygun kanal seçilmezse çok gürültü olabilir. Kanal taraması için arduino kodları var, doğru kanalı bulmak için onlardan yararlanabilirsiniz. Nrf24 modülü 3.3 volt ile çalışıyor. Fakat çektiği yüksek akım sebebiyle Arduino Nanonun 3.3 V pininden beslemesi biraz riskli. Onun yerine 5V pininin voltajını 2 diyot yardımıyle düşürüp öyle besledim. Harici bir regülatör bağlamak çok daha akla yatkın bir çözüm olacaktır tabi :) Payload size 10 olarak belirledim. Nedeni 5 adet integer verisi yollamam 2*5=10 byte göndermem gerekiyor. Normalde bir paket 32 byte fakat 10 byte ile sınırlandırarak rf modulünüzün performansını artırabilirsiniz. Başta belirlediğim ID sayesinde farklı birden fazla ID belirleyerek, birden fazla sayıda aracı kontrol edebilirsiniz. Max angle 12 veya datatosend[2]=-1*(analogRead(3)-500)*Max_angle/500; gibi satırlar tamamen kullanıma örnek olması amacıyla konmuştur. Yapmanız gereken sadece joysticklerden veya potansiyometreden aldığınız veriyi nasıl göndermek isterseniz o şekile çevirip \u0026ldquo;datatosend\u0026rdquo; array elemanlarına eşitlemektir. İstediğiniz türde aracı veya çok fazla farklı kanalı bu şekilde rahatça kontrol edebilirsiniz.\nKumanda Kodu\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 #include \u0026lt;SPI.h\u0026gt; #include \u0026lt;RF24.h\u0026gt; #include \u0026#34;nRF24L01.h\u0026#34; RF24 radio(7,8); int ID=1; int Max_angle=12; void setup() { radio.begin(); radio.setPayloadSize(10); radio.setChannel(80); radio.openWritingPipe(0xF0F0F0F0F0); radio.openReadingPipe(1,0xF0F0F0F0AA); radio.startListening(); } void loop() { int datatosend[5]; datatosend[0]=ID; datatosend[1]=(analogRead(0)-500)*2; datatosend[2]=-1*(analogRead(3)-500)*Max_angle/500; datatosend[3]=(analogRead(4)-500)*Max_angle/500; datatosend[4]=-1*(analogRead(1)-500)*Max_angle/500; datatosend[5]=(analogRead(2)-500)*Max_angle/500; radio.stopListening(); radio.write( datatosend, sizeof(datatosend) ); radio.startListening(); delay(50); } Aşağıdaki kod ise RC verilerini almak için gerekli fonksiyondur değiken boyutlarını ayarlayarak channel sayısını artırabilirsiniz.

Başlamadan önce benim de kullanacağım 8051 entegresi simülasyon programını önermek istiyorum. Programın ismi EdSim51. İlkönce mikroişlemcilerle alakalı temel bir kaç kavramla başlayalım.\nROM(Read Only Memory): Temel olarak, belli bir miktarda bilginin kalıcı olarak yazıldığı bellektir**.** Bilgi saklamak için\nEEPROM: ROM\u0026rsquo;un yeniden yazılabilir halidir.\nRAM(Random Access Memory): Bilgi saklamak için elektriğe ihtiyaç duyar. CPU veri işlemek için kullandığı bellek tipi RAM\u0026rsquo;dir.\nRegisters: CPU registerları verileri geçici olarak saklamak için kullanılır. 8051 entegresinde bir tane data çeşidi vardır. O da 8 bittir. Eğer 8 bitten büyük datalarla işlem yapılmak istenirse data 8 bitlik parçalara ayrılmalıdır. 8051\u0026rsquo;de en çok kullanılar registerlar aşağıdaki gibidir.\nA (accumulator) : Lojik ve numeric işlemleri gerçekleştirmede kullanılır R0, R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6 : Genel amaçlı registerlar DTPR (data pointer) : low ve high olmak üzere 2 bytedan oluşur bu sayede 16 bitlik veri saklanır. PC (program counter) : Programın Kod hafızasındaki kaçıncı işlemde olduğunu tutar PSW (Program Status Word) : Aşağıda tekrar değineceğim Stack Pointer Register: Yine 8 bitlik stackin en üzerindeki adresi gösteren registerdır. 1.8051 Entegresi Bazı Assembly Komutları ve Örnekleri MOV Komutu: Bir registera veri yüklemek için kullanılır. Kullanımı şöyledir:\nMOV data yüklenecek register, yüklenecek data\n1 MOV A,#51H A registerına 51 hexadecimal sayısı yükleniştir. # Bir sayı olduğunu görtermek için kullanılmıştır.\n51 yüklenecek hexadecimal sayımız. Değeri 5x16+1=81\nH sayının hexadecimal olduğunu göstermek için kullanılır.

PSW registerını kullanarak tabi ki:\nPSW Registerı\n8 bitlik bir registerdır. Her biri ayrı bir durumu tutar.\nCY (PSW.7): Carry Flag yani eldeyi tutan bit budur. CLR C komutu ile temizlenebilir.\nAC (PSW.6); Auxiliary Carry Flag D3 bitinden D4 bitine elde olduğunda 1 olan bittir.\nF0 (PSW.5 ve PSW.1); Kullanıcının kendi tanımlayacağı şeyler için ayrılmıştır.\nRS1 and RS0 (PSW.4 ve PSW.3): Register Bank değiştirmak için kullanılır.\nOV (PSW.2): Over flow flag\u0026rsquo;tir.\nP (PSW.0): Parity Flagtır. Accumulatordaki sayı tek ise 1, çift ise 0dır.\nSUBB komutu\nÇıkarma işlemi komutudur.\nSUBB A,B\nA=A-B\nMUL komutu\nÇarpım komutudur.\nMUL AB şeklinde kullanılır arada virgül yoktur. Sadece A ve B registerları kullanılabilir.\nA=A.B\nDIV komutu\nBölme komutudur.\nDIV AB şekilde kullnılır arada virgül yoktur.

This is the schematic of the circuit. Basically, LCD screen works with 12 volt and the Raspberry Pi 2 works with 5 volt. Therefore the circuit needs a regulator. There is a switch to cut the power from the battery. When battery is charging, the battery must be switch off and the circuit can be used with DC in jack on the LCD Driver Board. It is a good solution for off battery times.

Neden Raspberry Pi Laptop?\nRaspberry pi yazılım geliştirmek için çok önemli bir portal fakat her zaman uygun ekran klavye bulmak zor ve Raspberry Pi\u0026rsquo;ın taşınabilirliğini azaltıyor. Ayrıca üzerinde 4 usb portu, Hdmi portu gibi giriş çıkış birimleri bulunması sayesinde laptop yapılmaya oldukça uygun durumda. 3. olarak düşük güç tüketiminden söz edebiliriz.

Devrenin son hali aşağıdaki gibidir. Basitçe açıklamak gerekirse; LCD ekran 12 volt ile çalışırken Raspberry Pi 2 5 volt ile çalışıyor bu yüzden Lm2596 regülatör modulünü kullanarak 12 voltluk voltajımız 5 volta ayarlanıyor. Pilden devreye gelen gücü kesmek için araya bir anahtar koydum. Batarya şarj olurken anahtarı kapatıyorum bu sayede bataryadan akım çekimiyor. Ayrıca anahtar iletimde değilken LCD Driver Boardın üzerindeki DC IN jakı kullnılarak da devremi besleyebiliyorum. Batarya bittiğinde kullanmak için oldukça güzel bir çözüm oldu.

Bir çoğunuz sorabilir biraz daha para ödeyerek bu boyutlarda bir android tableti neden tercih etmediniz diye. Açıkcası bazı alanlarda öyle bir tabletin daha işe yarar olacağını kabul ediyorum. Fakat benim Raspberry Pi üzerinde yazılım geliştirmem gerek ve bu bulabildiğim en etkili çözüm oldu. Böylece çok farklı amaçlar için Raspberry Pi kullanabiliyorum.

Bunun için elimdeki fırçalı motor için elektronik hız kontrolü yani ESC (Electronic Speed Control) yapmaya karar verdim.\nÖncellikle kendi motorumun ve devrelerimin besleme gerilimi yazayım. Çünkü devre bu özelliklere göre dizayn edilecektir. Siz de kendi malzemelerinize ve voltajlarınıza göre kendi devrenizi dizayn edebilirsiniz. Benim elimdeki motoru besleme voltajım 7.4 volt ve motorun çektiği maximum akım 2 amperdir. Hız kontrolü için göndereceğim PWM sinyalinin genliği de (Arduinonun çalışma voltajı) 5 volttur.

Bunlardan ilk akıla geleni bataryanın uçlarına sabit direnç bağlayıp çekilen akım ve zaman üzerinden kapasite hesabı yapmaktır. Fakat bataryaların zamanla deşarj oldukça voltajı azalır bu da akımın değişmesine yol açacaktır. Bu sorunu çözmek için ise deşarj esnasında mümkün olduğunca çok voltaj örneklenerek anlık akım hesaplanıp interpolasyon yöntemleriyle kapasiteye ulaşılabilir. Fakat bu sıkıntıları aşmak için ikinci bir ölçüm yöntemi vardır; Sabit akım deşarj devresi.\nSabit akım deşarj devresi bataryadan sabit akım çekerek deşarj olmasını sağlar. Bu sayede doğrudan akımın çekildiği toplam zaman tutularak pilin kapasitesi kolayca hesaplanır. Devremize geçecek olursak gerekli malzemeler;\nIrfz44N mosfet lt1001 ya da lm358 opamp 9 voltluk pil 0.5 volt en az 1W direnç 100k (büyüklüğü çok kritik değil) Diyot (benimkiyle aynı değerleri almak için 1N914) Devreyi açıklamak gerekirse; 9 voltluk pil opampı sürmek ve referans voltajını oluşturmak için kullanılır. R2 direnci ve diyot sayesinde referans gerilimi oluşturulur. Referans gerilimi R1direncinin voltajına eşit olur böylece Vref / R1 = I akımı mosfet üzerinden dolayısıyla bataryadan çekilen akım olmuş olur. Bu yüzden Vref gerilimi sabit olmalıdır ki akım da sabit olsun. Bir diyot üzerinden akım geçirirken (diyota göre değişmekle birlikte) üzerinde 0.7 civarı voltaj düşümü yaşanır. Üzerinden geçen akım değiştikçe bu değer çok olmamakla birlikte değişir. Bu değerin etkisi ihmal edilebilecek seviyededir.\nBu devre standart voltajı 3.7 volt civarı olan lithium ion veya li po bataryaların testi için tasarlanmıştır. O voltajda bir batarya tam dolu iken 4.2 volt boş iken ise 3 volt civarında voltaja sahiptir. Aşağıda bataryanın voltajı 4.2 volttan 3 volta giderken akım grafiğini bulabilirsiniz. Bataryadan çekilen akım 965 mA seviyesindedir. Neredeyse hiç değişmez.\nBunun nedeni aşağıda görüldüğü gibi diyotun uçları arasındaki gerilimin de sabit olmasıdır.\nBu devrenin sıkıntılı yanlarından biri mosfet üzerinde çok fazla voltaj düşümü olmasıdır. Bu da mosfetin aşırı derecede ısınmasına yol açar. Bu sorun için mosfete ilave olarak kocaman bir heat sink takılması gerekir. Yine de tehlikeli olabilir devreyi yapacaklar için tavsiyem devre çalışmakta iken mosfete dokunmamalarıdır.\nDikkat edeceğimiz bir diğer nokta ise 9 voltluk pilden çekilen akım. R2 direnci yüksek tutularak 9 voltluk pilden çekilen akım azaltılır. Devrenin ömrü uzatılır.\n","permalink":"https://mozanunal.com/2015/08/bataryalar-icin-sabit-akm-desarj/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHerkese Merhabalar,\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBatarya kapasite testi için çeşitli yöntemler geliştirilmiştir.

Bu yazıyı yazmamın 2 sebebi var. PID algoritmaları hakkında bir çok yazı okudum fakat coğu akademik ve karmaşık yazılar. Benim amacım anlaşılırlığı ve ayrıntıyı dengeli bir şekilde maximum değerlerinde kullanmak. İkincisi ise bu algoritmanın özel olarak multikopterlerde kullanımını basit bir şekilde açıklayan bir yazıya rastlamadım. Bu yüzden bu yazıyı yazmaya karar verdim.\nBir otopilotun en temel 2 bileşeni hava aracının yönelimini tespit eden IMU sensörü ve PID algoritmasıdır. IMU sensörü içinde bir kaç sensör barındırır ve amacı hava aracının 3 boyutlu uzaydaki yönelimini bulmaktır. IMU konusundan bu yazımda bahsetmiştim. PID algoritmasının görevi ise temel olarak şöyledir: Yönelimi (3 eksendeki yere göre açılar) sensörler üzerinden alır, istenen açıları da kullanıcıdan alır. Bu ikisi arasındaki farkı en düşük seviyeye düşürmeyi amaçlar. İşte PID algoritmasının görevi bu farkı minimuma indirmek için gerekli motor hız değerlerini hesaplamaktır.\nMultikopterler için her 3 için ayrı ayrı PID kontrol algoritmaları uygulanır. İstenilen değer ile şu anki değerin farkı alınarak hata elde edilir. PID algoritması bu hata değerlerine uygulandıktan sonra motorların çıkış değerleri hesaplanır. Sonra bu verilen çıkış hata değişkenini bulmak üzere tekrar girişe yönlendirilir. Böylece döngü tamamlanmış olur. PID, Proportional, Integral ve Derivative olmak üzere 3 farklı algoritmanın uygulanmasıyla elde edilir. Örnekle açıklamak gerekirse: Multikopterimizin pitch açısı için kullnılan PID kontrol algoritmasını ele alalım. P algoritmasından gelen değer, multikopterimizin şu anki pitch açısı ile kontrol edenin istediği pitch açısı arasındaki farka yani anlık hataya bağlıdır. I algoritmasından gelen değer, pitch açısının geçmiş hatalarının toplamına bağlıdır. D algoritmasından gelen değer ise gelecek açı hatalarının tahminine bağlıdır.\n**Bu algoritmalardan elde edilen değerler belli katsayılarla(Kp, Ki, Kd) çarpılarak son çıkış değişkeni elde edilir. Bu katsayılara PID katsayıları denir. PID tuning olayı bu katsayıların uygun stabiliteyi sağlayacak şekilde ayarlanmasıdır. **Simdi bu 3 PID algoritmasının nasıl çalıştığını daha ayrıntılı inceleyelim.\nProportional\nProportional, ana kontrol algoritmamızdır. Diğer katsayılar 0 olsa bile sadece bu algoritmayla (stabilite düşük de olsa) hover yapabilir. Proportional, hava aracımızın şu anki açı hatasını baz alarak ilerler. Basitçe anlatmak gerekirse Kp katsayısı ne kadar yüksek olursa multikopter o kadar fazla kendini düzeltmeye çalışır. Eğer olması gerekenden yüksek Kp katsayısı seçilirse kendini fazla düzeltecek ve \u0026ldquo;overshoot\u0026rdquo; denen kavram ortaya çıkacaktır. Multikopter oldukça fazla duyarlı olacak ve yüksek frekansta titremeye başlayacaktır.\nIntegral\nIntegral, geçmiş hataların toplamını baz alarak ilerleyen algoritmadır. P genellikle hatayı yok etmek için tek başına yeterli değildir. Basitçe, istenen I değeri hataların zamanla çarpılıp toplanmasıyla elde edilir. Yani hatanın sayısal integrali hesaplanmış olur. I algoritması sayesinde multikopterimizin tam istediğimiz değere gelme özelliği artar fakat aynı zamanda istenilen değere gelme zamanı artar. Özellikle düzensiz rüzgarda ve ağırlık merkezi bozukluğu, tribulans gibi olumsuz etkenleri yok etmek için oldukça yararlıdır. Ki katsayısı artırıldığında daha yumuşak ve daha az agresif bir uçuş karakteristiği elde edilir. Yüksek Ki yine titreşimlere neden olur ama daha düşük frekanstadır böylece Kp\u0026rsquo;den kaynaklanan sorundan ayrılabilir.\nDerivative\nD parametresi gelecek hata tahminini baz alan bir parametredir. Etkisini ise istenilen açı değeri ile şuanki açı değeri arasındaki bir yay olarak düşünebiliriz. Görevi şokları absorbe ederek sonradan oluşabilecek hataları, \u0026ldquo;overshootları\u0026rdquo; baştan engellemektir. Bazı uçuş kontrolcüler bu parametreyi kullanmaz(Örnek: KK 2.0).\nPID Tuning İpuçları\nAyarlamaya P parametresinden başlanır. P parametresini ayarlamak için düşük bir değerden başlanır ve titreşim ve osilasyonlar görmeye başlayana kadar artırılır. Düşük frekanstaki osilasyonları Ki parametresine, Yüksek frekanstakiler is genellikle Kp veya Kd bağlıdır. Eğer aracınızda titreşimler görüyorsanız Kp parametresini azaltmak için acele etmeyin. İlk olarak Kd parametresini artırmayı deneyebilirsiniz.\nAkrobasi modu için;\nBirazcık yüksek P Birazcık düşük I D artırılır. Yumuşak akıcı uçuş için;\nBirazcık düşük P Birazcık yüksek I D azaltılır. Son olarak farklı PID ayarlarının stabiliteye etkisi hakkında açıklayıcı bir video göz atmanızı tavsiye ederim.

En ucuz SDR\u0026rsquo;ler genelde RTL2832U+R820T çip setlidir. Benim aldığım modül 25MHz - 1700MHz arası tarama yapabiliyor. Kendi anteni ve kumandasıyla beraber geldi. Genelde bu modullerle gelen antenlerle FMden başka bi şey dinleyebilmek pek mümkün olmuyor. Fakat geliştirilen uygun antenlerle Uluslararası Uzay İstasyonundan(ISS) bile veri alabilmek mümkün. Bunlardan kurulumdan sonra bahsedeceğim.\nEvet gelelim kullanma kısmına. Genelde yazılım olarak SDR# Programı kullanılıyor. Programın kullanımı oldukça kolay ve bir çok eklentisi bulunuyor. Bu yüzden ben de SDR# seçtim. Programı buradan indirebilirsiniz. Programın kurulumu oldukça basit o yüzden bu kısmı geçiyorum. Kurduktan sonra Driver değişimi yapmamız gerekiyor. Bunun için ise Zadig isimli programı kuallnabilirsiniz. Options\u0026rsquo;tan \u0026ldquo;Show All Devices\u0026rdquo; seçilir. Daha sonra \u0026ldquo;Bulk-In,Interface(Interface 0)\u0026rdquo; seçilir. Sağ taraftaki driver olarak \u0026ldquo;WinUSB\u0026rdquo; seçilir \u0026ldquo;Reinstall Driver\u0026rdquo; tıklanır ve uzun bir yükleme sürecinin ardından SDR# programı kullanıma hazırdır. İlk uygulama olarak FM dinleme uygulaması yaptım çünkü ekstra anten gerektirmiyor. Modulü denemek için ideal bir uygulama. Ayar butonuna tıklayıp ayarları aşağıdaki gibi yapıyoruz. Radio sekmesinin altına WFM seçilir. Alttaki ayarları bu uygulama için değiştirmeye gerek yok.\nGerekli ayarlar yapıldığında SDR# görüntüsü bu şekilde olacak. Sinyalin yüksek olduğu yerleri kırmızı renkten farkedebilirsiniz. Farklı kanallar ayrı ayrı gözükecektir.\nGelelim Sdr ile yapabileceklerinize: FM radio dinlenebilir, karasal TV yayınına bağlanabilir, ISS den veri almak, NOAA Hava durumu uydularından veri ve resim almak(Wxtoimg), amatör radyo bandında iletişim kurmak, uçakların koordinant verilerini almak, GPS uydularına bağlanmak gibi uygun frekans aralığında iletişim kurulabilir.

Bu programlar windows kullanıcılarının aşina olduğu, güzel alternatif programlar. Ben de kullandığım bu programları sizinle paylaşmak istedim. Yani öyle Linux\u0026rsquo;taki en iyi 10 program bunlar, hepsi sıfır hatalı diye iddalı bir başlıkla çıkmıyorum kaşınıza :D. Neyse programlara geçelim.\nİlk program Ubuntu Software Center. Bu program üzerinden Ubuntu\u0026rsquo;da çalışabilen bir çok programa ulaşabiliyorsunuz ve onları indirip kurabiliyorsunuz. Güzel şekilde kategorize edilmiş ve eklenti seçeneklerini seçme özelliği eklenmiş gerçekten hoş ve işleri kolaylaştıran bir program. İkincisi, olmazsa olmaz programımız Mozilla Firefox. İnternete girmek tabi ki Ubuntu\u0026rsquo;da da sıkça kullanılan bir eylem. Mozilla bu iş için en iyi araçlardan biri. Bir tarayıcıdan istenilen tüm özelliklere sahip. Sıradaki programımız GIMP. Bu bir resim düzenleme programı. Özellikleri ise ünlü Photoshop programı ile yarışır düzeyde. Efektleri, filtreleri, layerlarla çalışabilme özellikleri hoş gerçekten. Evveeet! 4. Sıradaki programımız Phyton IDLE. Phyton 2 ve 3 için ayrı versiyonları mevcut. Linuxun anadillerinden biri olan Phyton\u0026rsquo;da kod yazmak için sayısız IDE seçeneğinizden biri. Basitliğiyle beni cezbetti. Programı açmışken de bir \u0026ldquo;Hello World\u0026rdquo; yazmamak olmaz dedim, yazdım. Programımız Libre Office. Bu program Microsoft Office alternatifi olarak düşünülmüş. Onun dosyalarını açabiliyor, değiştirebiliyor. Nerdeyse tüm Office dosya türlerini destekliyor. ]\nProgramımız gerçekten bedava alternatifleri arasında en iyi program. İsmi Blender. Bu programla 3D modelleme, animasyonlar, efektler yapabilirsiniz. Hatta mevcut oyun motoru ile kendi 3D oyununuzu yapabilirsiniz. Program gerçekten çok professyonel, modelleme, texturing, animasyon yapma konusunda çok başarılı. Başka platformların kullanıcısı olsanız bile denemenizi şiddetle tavsiye ediyorum. Arduino, Open Source camiasının en popüler platformlarından biri. Arduinoyu bilmeyenler için anlatayım. Hobi elektronikçileri için üretilmiş mikro denetleyici kartı. Oldukça popüler ve çok çeşitli uygulamaları mevcut. Bu program ise o karta kod yazmaya ve derleyip yüklemeye yarıyor. Java tabanlı bir program olduğu için Linux\u0026rsquo;ta sorunsuz çalışıyor. Vlc player medya dosyaları oynatmada (her türlü video ve ses dosyası) Windows\u0026rsquo;ta olduğu gibi Ubuntu\u0026rsquo;da da yanımızda. 9.Programımız Ubuntu terminal programı. Linux tabanlı işletim sistemlerinde aslında çoğu iş terminalden yapılıyor. Ubuntuda bu biraz azaltılmış fakat yine de oldukça lazım olan bir program zaten dahili olarak bulunuyor. Bir çok işlem buradan yürütülüyor. Mesela aşağıdaki kodda ben ekran görüntüsünü almıştım. Ve son programımız, Eclipse. Bu program açık kaynak kodlu bir IDE. Bir çok programlama dilini destekliyor. En çok Java dilinde program geliştirmek için kullanılıyor. Oldukça kullanışlı ve güçlü bir yazılım geliştirme aracı son olarak, bunu da tavsiye ediyorum.

IMU modullerinin hayati önem taşımasının sebebi, modüllerin yönelim açılarını hesaplamak için kullanılmasıdır. En büyük yolcu uçağından, roketten en küçük bir quadrokoptere kadar tüm hava araçları stabil ve sağlıklı bir uçuş için bu modullerden birine sahip olmalıdırlar.\nIMU ingilizcedeki \u0026ldquo;Inertial Mesurament Unit\u0026rdquo; kelime grubunun kısaltılmış halidir. IMU ile bir cismin uzaydaki 3 boyutlu yönelimi bulunabilir. 3 boyutlu yönelimi anlatmanın en kolay yolu Euler Açılarını kullanmaktır. Havacılık sektöründe sıklıkla Euler açılarının özelleşmiş bir versiyonu olan \u0026ldquo;Yaw, Pitch, Roll\u0026rdquo; açıları kullanılmaktadır.\nBir nesnenin uzaydaki yönelimini bulmak için 3 temel sensör kullanılır. Bunlar ivmeölçer, gyro ve magnometredir. Bu üç sensörün bir arada kullanılmasının nedeni şudur: İvme ölçer ile Pitch ve Roll açısı tespit edilebilir fakat hareket anında gürültü oluşur ve doğru bilgi elde edilemez, Gyro ise 3 eksendeki açısal hızları verir. Eğer ilk açı bilinmiyorsa sadece gyro ile şu anki açılar hesaplanamaz, sadece açısal hız üzerinden açısal açı değişimi hesaplanabilir. Gyronun ikinci kötü özelliği ise \u0026ldquo;Drift\u0026rdquo; özelliğidir. Gyro sabit durun bir cisimde bile küçük de olsa açısal hızlar hesaplar. Bu nedenle sadece Gyroya bağlı sistemlerde hesaplanan açılar yavaş yavaş kayar. Bunu engellemek için bazı filtreler kullanılır. Bu filtrelerin amacı Gyro üzerinden verileri alıp ivme ölçer üzerinden bu verileri düzeltmektir. Böylece drift engellenmiş olur ve sadece ivmeölçere bağlı olunmadığı için hareket halindeki gürültü sonuçlardan kurtulunmuş olur. Fakat ivmeölçer sadece pitch ve roll açılarını hesaplayabildiği için yaw eksenine referans olamaz. Yaw eksenine referans olması için kullanılan modül magnometredir. Bu sayede değişik algoritmalar ve filtreler kullanılarak gyro üzerinden hesaplanan açısal değişimler, pitch ve roll eksenlerinde ivmeölçer, yaw ekseninde ise magnometre tarafından düzeltilerek yönelim açılarının hesaplanması sağlanır.\nYaw, Pitch, Roll açıları yani Euler açıları bazı durumlarda 3 boyutlu yönelimi açıklamada yetersiz kalır. Özetlemek gerekirse rotasyonlar sonucu eğer eksenler üst üste gelirse özgürlük derecesi kaybı yaşanır. Rotasyon da 2 boyutlu uzaya sıkışmak zorunda kalır. Bu duruma Gimbal Lock denir. Gimbal Lock kavramının açıklandığı şu videoyu izleyebilirsiniz.\nİşte bu gimbal lock sorunu ortadan kaldırmak için 3 boyutlu yönelimi göstermek için yeni yöntemler bulunmuştur. Bunlardan başlıcaları \u0026ldquo;Quaternion \u0026quot; ve \u0026quot; Direction Cosine Matrix\u0026rdquo; yöntemleridir. Artık yönelimi göstermek için 3 açı yerine \u0026ldquo;Quaternion\u0026quot;da 4 değişkenli bir vektör ve \u0026ldquo;Direction Cosine Matrix\u0026quot;te 3x3\u0026rsquo;lük bir matris ve çok daha karışık algoritmalar kullanılır. IMU sensörlerin beraber çalışması için kullanılan bazı algoritmaları aşağıda kısa bilgilerle birlikte yazacağım.\nComplementary Filter: Sabit bir ağırlıklı ortalama oranıyla gyro verileri ile referans verilerin ortalaması alınması yöntemidir. En basit algoritmadır. Genelde hobi amaçlı ve işin mantığını kavrama amaçlı uygulamalarda kullanılır.\nKalman Filter: Karmaşık bir algoritması vardır değişken ağırlıklı ortalama oranıyla hesaplama yapar, bu oranı hesaplamak için çok farklı yöntemler kullanabilir.\nMahony Madwick Filter: 3 sensörden alınan verilerle quaternion hesaplamak için kullanılan filtredir.\nDirection Cosine Matrix: Basitçe yönelim vektörü ile 3 koordinat ekseni arasındaki açıların kosinüslerinden oluşan matristir.\nBen de bu anlattıklarımı somutlaştırmak adına İmu açılarının 3 boyutlu görsellenmesi üzerine bir proje yaptım. Bu projede ne yazık ki Imu değerlerini kendim hesaplamadım FreeIMU kütüphanesini kullandım. Görselleme Gimbal Lock sorunundan açınmak için Quaternion kullanılarak yapıldı. Sensör olarak MPU6050 sensörünü kullandım. İçinde 3 eksen gyro ve 3 eksen ivme ölçer bulundurmakta. 3 boyutlu görselleme için processing programa dilinde yazılan bir uygulamayı kullandım.\nProjenin kaynak kodunu buradan indirebilirsiniz.\n","permalink":"https://mozanunal.com/2014/11/imu-aclarnn-3-boyutlu-olarak/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHerkese Merhabalar!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBu yazımda size hava araçlarının en temel elektronik ekipmanı olan IMU modullerinden bahsetmek istiyorum.

Bu uygulamada C# programlama dili ve Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 kullanılmıştır. C# ile grafik çizmemize olanak sağlayan zed graph kütüphanesinden yararlanılmıştır.Bu kütüphaneyi buradan indirebilirsiniz. Sistemin genel algoritmasına bakarsak şöyle çalışır; seri porttan veri okunur, veri aralardaki virgüllere göre parse edilip labellera aktarılır, Eklenen \u0026ldquo;Timer\u0026rdquo; öğesi ile timerın her periyodunda zaman belirten labela geçen zaman kadar eklenir böylece kaçıncı saniye olduğu tutulur, aynı zamanda timerın her bir periyodunda x değerleri zaman, y değerleri data noktaları olmak üzere grafiğe bir nokta eklenir. Şimdi çalışma şeklini daha ayrıntılı bir şekilde inceleyelim.\nMikrodenetleyici-bilgisayar iletişimi projelerinde olmazsa olmazlardan biri Seri porttan veri okumaktır. Bu sayede mikrodenetleyici ile iletişim kurabiliriz ve veri alışverişinde bulunabiliriz. Aynı zamanda bilgisayar kontrollü robotikte de komut vermek için kullanılır. C# üzerinden serial port programı yazma işlemi oldukça kolaylaştırılmıştır. Seri port öğesi eklenir ve ayarları yapılır. Buradaki ayarlar veri transfer hızı hangi Com Portun okunacağının ayarı v.b. \u0026ldquo;Save to text\u0026rdquo; özelliği de gelen veriyi saklayıp sonra tekrar inceleme imkanı sunar.Asıl konumuz bu olmadığı için çok ayrıntıya girmiyorum zaten kolayca örnekleri bulunabilir.\nİkinci kısım seri porttan alınan verinin uygun şekilde parçalandığı ve labellara aktarıldığı bölümdür. Bunun için \u0026ldquo;Display Text\u0026rdquo; isimli bir fonksiyon yazılmıştır. Bu fonksiyon ile gelen verinin her satırının şekli\n1 $,data1,data2,data3 olarak belirlenmiştir. Fonksiyonun algoritması şu şekildedir; gelen verinin ilk harfi \u0026ldquo;$\u0026rdquo; değilse veriyi işlemez, eğer ilk harfi oysa virgül sayısına bakar(Stringin içinden belli bir karakteri arama fonksiyonu kullanılmıştır.), eğer o da 3\u0026rsquo;e eşit ise gelen veriyi virgüllere göre parçalar ve ilk kısım hariç(\u0026quot;$\u0026quot;) kalan veriyi, tek tek 3 ayrı labela aktarır böylece gelen data1, data2, data3 ayrı labellara aktarılmış olur.\nGrafik çizdirme kısmına geçmeden önce grafiği çizen timerı açan ve kapatan 2 butondan bahsedeyim. Bunlar sayesinde grafik çizdirme başlatılır ve durdurulur. Yani butonların tıklama \u0026ldquo;event\u0026quot;lerinde sadece timer1.enable=true; ve timer1.enable=false kodu vardır.(Tabi ayrı ayrı birinde true olan diğerinde false olan )\nResimde altta eklediğimiz SeriPort ve timer1 öğesini görebilirsiniz. \u0026ldquo;FileDiaglog\u0026rdquo; öğeleri ise text dosyasına kaydetmek için ve bir text dostasını seri porttan yollamak için kullanılır.\nilk önce grafiğin ayarlarından başlayalım. Grafiğe bir çizim alanı yanı \u0026ldquo;pane\u0026rdquo; ekleyelim. Çizdiğimiz her şeyi hangi \u0026ldquo;pane\u0026quot;e çizdiğimizi belirtmek zorundayız. Eksenlere isim koymamız ve daha bir sürü ayar yapmamız mümkün ama ben karışıklık yaratmamak adına sade bir grafik tercih ettim. ZedGraph kütüphanesi yapabileceğiniz diğer ayarlar ile çok farklı grafikler çizdirme imkanı sunar. Grafiğin altını doldurma, nokta grafiği, sütun ve daire grafiği gibi çeşit ve renk opsiyonları mevcuttur. Bu çeşitlerin bazılarına buradan ulaşabilirsiniz.\nGrafik ayarlarında önemli bir yerlerden biri de \u0026ldquo;Point pair list\u0026quot;in ve \u0026ldquo;Line item\u0026quot;ın belirlenmesidir. Çizilecek her eğri için birer tane bunlardan belirlenmelidir. \u0026ldquo;RolingPointPairList\u0026rdquo; seçilmesinin sebebi ise \u0026ldquo;rolling\u0026rdquo; olduğunda en fazla seçilen kadar(burada en fazla 40 nokta çifti) noktanın hafızada saklaması böylece bir süre sonra biriken noktaların bilgisayarda yavaşlama meydana getirmesinin engellenmesidir. Belli aralıklarla zaten grafik üstüne sağ tıklanarak resim olarak kaydetme opsiyonu da mevcuttur.\nGelelim grafiği çizdirme kısmına. İlk önce grafiğe bir \u0026ldquo;Timer\u0026rdquo; öğesi eklenir ve periyodu 1000 ms(1 saniye) olarak belirlenir. Bu tamamen opsiyoneldir ne kadarlık zaman aralıklarında grafiğimize nokta eklenmesi istendiğine bağlıdır.İlk 3 satırdaki kodlar ile bir labelda şu anki saniyenin tutulması sağlanır(Zaman bizim x koordinatımız olduğu için anlık olarak kulanılması gereklidir). Sonraki kısımlar ise grafiğe nokta eklenmesi algoritmasıdır. Gelen verileri yukarıda parçalayıp labellara aktarmıştık burda ise o labellar ve zaman labelı kullanılarak nokta çifleri elde edilir. Nokta çiftleri, nokta listelerine aktarılır sonra bunlar birleştirilerek eğri çizilir. myCurveOne = myPane.AddCurve(null, listPointsOne, Color.Blue, SymbolType.Circle) bu satır ile eğrinin hangi \u0026ldquo;pane\u0026quot;e çizileceği, rengi, noktaların gösteren sembol (yuvarlak,yıldız,kare), eğrinin altının dolu-boş olacağı belirlenir. En alt kısımda grafik yenilerek yeni eğrinin çizilmesi graifğin gördüğümüz yerinin eğrimize paralel olarak uygun şekilde yer değiştirmesi sağlanır. Böylece Bilgisayara hiç değmeden grafiğin takibi otomatik olarak yapılmış olur.\nAşağıda programımızın son hali bulunmaktadır. En kısa zamanda videosunu eklemeye çalışacağım. Görselleme, telemetri projelerinde ve bilgisayarla kontrol projelerinde en önemli noktalardan biridir(ya da pid, sensor test ederken). Programımız da bu ihtiyaca yönelik yazılmıştır. Arduino ve ya pic ile (ya da seri porttan haberleşebilen tüm işlemciler) rahatlıkla çalışabilecek bir uygulamadır. C# ile yapılan gerçek zamanlı (real time) uygulama eksikliğinden bu konuyu yapma ihtiyacı hissettim. Ben bu konuyu araştırırken bu uygulamayı gerçek zamanlı yapan ve sonra nasıl yapıldığını anlatan bir kaynak bulamamıştım.Umarım bu bilgiler işinize yarar. Paylaşımlarınızda kaynak belirtirseniz çok iyi olur :).

Bu uygulamada C# programlama dili ve Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 kullanılmıştır. C# ile grafik çizmemize olanak sağlayan zed graph kütüphanesinden yararlanılmıştır.\u003ca href=\"https://zedgraph.sourceforge.net/index.html\"\u003eBu kütüphaneyi buradan indirebilirsiniz\u003c/a\u003e. Sistemin genel algoritmasına bakarsak şöyle çalışır; seri porttan veri okunur, veri aralardaki virgüllere göre parse edilip labellera aktarılır, Eklenen \u0026ldquo;Timer\u0026rdquo; öğesi ile timerın her periyodunda zaman belirten labela geçen zaman kadar eklenir böylece kaçıncı saniye olduğu tutulur, aynı zamanda timerın her bir periyodunda x değerleri zaman, y değerleri data noktaları olmak üzere grafiğe bir nokta eklenir.
