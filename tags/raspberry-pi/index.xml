      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hello,&lt;/strong&gt; Steam Link is software which provides support to Steam to stream
screen view of the games to devices which is on same local area network. In this
setup, there are 2 devices. First one is the device to run the Steam and the
games which act as a server. The second one is the one which runs Steam Link and
acts as a client to this server. By using this technology you can play games
directly on a device which is connected to the same router. The connection is
also 2 way. Thus, control devices such as keyboard, mouse and game controllers
can be connected directly to the client device.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
