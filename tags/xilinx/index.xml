In this post, the Pmod microphone driver which is written in Verilog for Zynq boards is discussed. The driver is developed for Digilent Design Competition 2017. We have a project which microphone array is used. Therefore we have to get data from Pmod Mic also 5 of them should work synchronously. The microphone is sampled with an external ADC and this ADC is using basic SPI for communication. This module should be added to main FPGA code and you should make the connections required.</description></item></channel></rss>
