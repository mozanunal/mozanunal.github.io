Let&amp;rsquo;s start!
What is ECG? Electrocardiography (ECG) is the measurement of the bioelectrical activity during the contraction and relaxation stages of the atria and ventricles of the heart, the stimulation of the heart and the conduction of the stimulus. ECG signal has some specific waves which correspond to particular conditions.
Part of the ECG Signal ECG Circuit During this process, a 9V battery was used as a source to prevent leakage current through the person to whom the electrodes were connected and the sockets to which the oscilloscopes were connected were checked.</description></item></channel></rss>
