### Achievements and Side Projects

**SparseCT**
2021, [Github Link](https://github.com/mozanunal/SparseCT)
This repo is a tool to develop sparse view CT reconstruction projects and compare different methods easily.

**Img2sh**
2019, [Github Link](https://github.com/mozanunal/img2sh).
Img2sh is a tool to show images directly on the terminal. For color images, 256 xterm color support is required. This script basically resize the image with antialiasing and quantized its colors to xterm color pallette.

**SimpleDSP**
2018, [Github Link](https://github.com/mozanunal/SimpleDSP).
SimpleDSP is a basic DSP library which is for Arduino and most of the microcontrollers which can be programmed in C/C++.

**Digilent Design Contest**
2017, Digilent Cluj, Romania.
It was a competition about Xilinx FPGA based systems. The project for this competition was the detection of sound direction using the microphone arrays.

**NASA Space Apps Challenge**
2017, Istanbul, Turkey, **1st Place**.
It was an international hackathon organized by NASA. 1st place was taken by a project to assist people with their own UV exposure using Internet of Things systems.

**ITUNOM**
2014 - 2016, Maryland, USA.
Unmanned Air Vehicle Team. It was a team about unmanned air vehicles at Istanbul Technical University. This team participated in AUVSI Student Unmanned Air Systems Competition 2015 and 2016. In 2016, ITUNOM was 13th in total and 1st among multi-copter participants. My task in this project was the software team leader. I worked on image processing OpenCV, networking, and flight control systems.

**Siemens Hackathon Industry 4.0**
2016, 3rd place.

**Nasa Space Apps Challenge**
2015, Peopleâ€™s Choice Award.

**Intercollegiate Rocket Engineering Competition**
2013, Utah, USA.
ITU Iskandil Team, is a team that is involved in rocket-engineering. In June 2013, this competition was attended. I was on the avionics team of this group. Arduino and PIC microprocessors are to be programmed in accordance with their competition duties. Providing communication with the ground station tracking interface and long-distance radio modules required for real-time tracking of the rocket.

**My Blog**
2013 - present, [mozanunal.com](https://mozanunal.com).
I decided to open a blog (2013) so that I could archive my projects and make them available to everyone. In my blog, you can reach various kinds of content which are usually about Programming, Data Science, Drones, Electronics. Since 2013, I have been writing around 100 blog posts and projects and they have been visited by more than 800.000 people.
