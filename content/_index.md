Welcome to my digital home. This is where I document my work, from open-source
projects and architectural deep-dives to published academic papers. My goal is
to share practical knowledge at the intersection of software engineering and
machine learning.

### Highlights

I recommend starting with one of these highlights:

- **Project & Post:** **[sllm.nvim](/2025/05/sllm.nvim/)** — A Neovim plugin for
  seamless LLM integration. Read the announcement post to see how it works.
- **Architecture:** **[No-Build Client Islands](/2025/05/client-islands/)** — A
  guide to building long-lasting, framework-free web apps.
- **Research:** **[My Papers](/papers/)** — My published work on low-dose CT
  reconstruction using deep learning.
