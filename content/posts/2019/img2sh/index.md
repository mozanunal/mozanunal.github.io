# Img2sh

Hello there,

_In this post, I want to tell a brief story of how I have created a tool named
img2sh. It is also my first python package which is published over PyPI. In this
very post, I will try to answer questions like: How is it developed? What are
the challenges? How should a package created and deployed over PyPI? Let's
continue!_

Img2sh is a tool to show images directly on the terminal. For colored images,
256 xterm color support is required. This script basically resizes the image
with anti-aliasing and quantized its colors to xterm color pallette.
[Github repository of the project can be reached from here](https://github.com/mozanunal/img2sh)

## Demo

Testing the package is super easy. Install using pip and run.

```bash
pip install img2sh --user
img2sh demo.jpeg
```

Result:

**Interactive mode**

```bash
img2sh demo.jpeg -w 80 -i

q: quit z: zoom+ x: zoom- c: reset 
arrow keys for navigation 
cmd: q
```

For detailed usage arguments:

```bash
$ python img2sh/cli.py --help

usage: cli.py [-h] [-w WIDTH] [-i] Image

Show images directly on terminal.

positional arguments:
  Image                 the directory of the image which will be opened

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -w WIDTH, --width WIDTH
                        image width on the terminal
  -i, --interactive     open image in interactive mode
```

## Story

As it can be understood from its name, img2sh is a python app to show images
directly in the terminal. I think it could be helpful when connected over ssh to
a server with no desktop environment. The images can be examined quickly on the
terminal screen. While the tool was developed, the followings are the challenges
I have encountered.

### Images

In the digital world, images are made of pixels. Pixel is the smallest part of
the image which can contain only one color. Color changes with the pixel
intensity values. To keep it simple, I added a grayscale image to illustrate the
pixel concept. It is a quite low resolution, grayscale image. Pixel values are
shown in the following image. Pixel intensity values are changing with how far
the pixel value close to black or white.

Colored images basically work with the same concept. The difference is colored
images are usually indicated with 3 different pixel values which are red, blue
and green. By this method, the proportion of these color intensity is changed to
show different colors on screen.

### Colors in terminal

How the coloring mechanism works in the terminal should be figured out to
implement this app. I understood clearly how colors are handling in an image
using the following link. After that, I have found colored python module which
provides support for colored terminal output from python apps. I implement the
colors using this library.

### Parsing command-line arguments

How should the command line arguments be parsed? Actually it is quite easy with
python. Let's examine the next code block:

```python
import argparse

parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(
    description='Show images directly on terminal.')
parser.add_argument("Image", help="the directory of the image which will be opened")
parser.add_argument(
    "-w", "--width",
    help="image width on the terminal",
    type=int
)
parser.add_argument(
    "-i", "--interactive",
    default=False, action='store_true',
    help="open image in interactive mode",
)

args = parser.parse_args()
```

After the initialization, arguments can be used with commands like `args.width`.
The arguments can be configured as mandatory or optional and the type of
argument also be specified. This package is a pretty useful and standard package
that is widely used most of the python projects.

### Image formats

For further improvement in the project, it should be solved how different image
formats can handle. Fortunately, Pillow package can handle various kinds of
image formats such as jpeg, png, tiff. This packet can provide pixel values for
different image types using the same get_pixel method interface. However, the
problem is the dimension of the color values are representing. At standard jpeg
a pixel value is represented with 24 bits which are 3 bytes. Each byte value
represents a different color channels Red, Blue, and Green. Png differs from the
alpha channel. At PNG images, colors are created with 4 bytes. Red, Blue, Green,
and Alpha. Alpha is the transparency channel of the image. So the dimension of
the pixel is different. But this problem is easily solved in findNearestColor
function. In these functions, the dimension of the pixel is handled.

### Setup.py

In this section, I will try to answer the question that how to create a setup.py
file which supports also entry point and can be executed without python shell.
Setup.py file is used to define the python package metadata and its installation
instructions.

```python
from setuptools import setup, find_packages

with open('requirements.txt') as f:
    requirements = f.read().splitlines()

setup(
    name='img2sh',
    version=__import__('img2sh').__version__,
    install_requires=requirements,
    description=(
        'Show images directly on terminal using Xterm colors.'
    ),
    long_description=open('README.md').read(),
    long_description_content_type='text/markdown',
    author="Mehmet Ozan Unal",
    author_email='mehmetozanunal@gmail.com',
    maintainer="Mehmet Ozan Unal",
    maintainer_email='mehmetozanunal@gmail.com',
    license="MIT",
    packages=find_packages(),
    platforms=["all"],
    url='https://github.com/mozanunal/img2sh',
    classifiers=[
        'Development Status :: 4 - Beta',
        'Operating System :: OS Independent',
        'Intended Audience :: Developers',
        'License :: OSI Approved :: BSD License',
        'Programming Language :: Python',
        'Programming Language :: Python :: Implementation',
        'Programming Language :: Python :: 2',
        'Programming Language :: Python :: 2.7',
        'Programming Language :: Python :: 3',
        'Programming Language :: Python :: 3.4',
        'Programming Language :: Python :: 3.5',
        'Programming Language :: Python :: 3.6',
        'Programming Language :: Python :: 3.7',
        'Topic :: Software Development :: Libraries'
    ],
    entry_points={
        'console_scripts': ['img2sh=img2sh.cli:main'],
    },
)
```

The entry points of the module can be specified with specifying entry_points
property of the object. It is defined as console script and first, the name of
the executable should be written. It should be mapped to the executable python
function. In my case, it is img2sh:cli:main.

There are useful tricks in the code block also. For example, you do not have to
write a whole long description of this file. It can be read from different files
like `README.md`. It is the same for your requirements. It still can be read
from requirements.txt but with one condition. These files should be specified in
the MANIFEST.in file.

MANIFEST.in

```bash
include README.md
include requirements.txt
include LICENCE
```

The following link great resource to create a setup.py file. I learned from
here. You should check it out.

### Uploading python package

As you may already know, python packages are usually distributed using PyPI
servers. When we use the pip package manager in default, packages are downloaded
from this server. In this project, I want that my package can be installed over
PyPI. So I created a PyPI account and upload my package there.\
to Uploading the PyPI package actually quite simple. The following commands are
required to create a package from a module and to upload it to PyPI servers.

```
python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
twine upload --repository-url https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*
```

### Optimizing performance

How can be the performance of the tool optimized? In the first prototype, the
code is written with simple logic. This causes too much processing time because
of the for loops inside it. The following code part is written to find the
nearest color inside a palette. The function loops in pallette and tries to find
the smallest distance. In version 2, I implement it using numpy package. The
operation executes in vectorial form and its execution time decreased
exponentially. v1

```python
def findNearestColor(color, pallette):
    distances = []
    if len(color) == 3:
        (colorr, colorg, colorb) = color
    elif len(color) == 4:
        (colorr, colorg, colorb, alpha) = color
        if alpha == 0:
            return None  # pallette.index((255,255,255))
    for c in pallette:
        (cr, cg, cb) = c
        distances.append(
            (colorr-cr)**2 +
            (colorg-cg)**2 +
            (colorb-cb)**2
        )
    return distances.index(min(distances))
```

v2

```python
def findNearestColor(color, pallette):
    distances = []
    if len(color) == 3:
        (colorr, colorg, colorb) = color
    elif len(color) == 4:
        (colorr, colorg, colorb, alpha) = color
        if alpha == 0:
            return None  # pallette.index((255,255,255))
    c = (colorr, colorg, colorb)
    diff = pallette - c
    diffSum = np.sum( np.square(diff), axis=1)
    return np.argmin(diffSum)
```

```bash
# for v1
real 0m2,618s
user 0m2,519s
sys 0m0,080s

# for v2
real 0m1,690s
user 0m1,892s
sys 0m0,417s
```

Thank you for your interest. See you later...
